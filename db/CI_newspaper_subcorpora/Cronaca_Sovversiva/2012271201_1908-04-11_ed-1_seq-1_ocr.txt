We are hàving a panie; and ali that you
know òf the how and the wherefore of it,
is that you are laid off, there is no work,
your savings are dwindling very fast, you
do not know how you are going to pay your
rent a month from now, or two or three
months at most, nor how you are to get
food for yourself and those depending on
you. These things you know, with a despe
rate and unsparing certainty, that does not
quit you, day or night, and makes you
haggard, restless and futile'n ali you 1111
dertake. As for the rest, it is ali a' muddle;
how it carne about, who is to blame or
what is to blame, of thisyou have a mass
of indistinct and coutradictory impressions
gotten from your newspaper, your corner
saloon or grocery, your boss or jour shop
mates, none' of whom have any clearer
conception than yourself, and every one a
different conceptióli. One'thing seems con
clusive ineither you, nor any one of these,
has any more power over the condition than
over a thunderstorm; the social wheels are
coming to a stop- and no one is ablé to
keep them turni ng. And yet society is
made for men, not men for society; society
is, or should be, an arrangement for the
mutuai benefit of ali its constituents; it is,
or it should be, sufficiently plastic to be re
moulded by the needs of its members. As it
is, however, so far from beingserved by the
social organizzatici!, the, securitj', well-be-ing,
health, evenutile bare existence of its
members, are destroyed wholesale, so that
Society-as-it-is may continue to exist; so
that bonds, banks, interest, rent, profit,
and taxes may continue their course un
disturbed. Beside these august institutions, '
hoary with time and respectability, human
fiesh and blood are weighed as nothing, and
men die in tlìeir hunger and despai r that
property may be preserved inviolate. So
curious is the human mind, developed un
der the pressure of Society-as it-is, that it
is thought better to sacrifìce the living
maker to the inanimate thing he has made.
Rather than take the food which was made
to be eaten, humanity dies of hunger gazing
at it; rather than warm itself with the coal
which was dug to be burned, a human
bejng freezes to 4eath in the secluded cor
ner of a coal yard; rather than clothe itself
with the garments which were made to be
worn, a rag-concealed body shivers imo .final
stiffness, while the unworn garments hang
upon metal "dummies". Under this half
matured idea of what society is for, the real
object of food- production is lost sight of ;
instead of being made to be , eaten, it is
made to sell; and the dealer in it will rather
throw it into the sea,' let it rot in the
markethouse, or burn it, than part with it
without selling it Coal is not dug to warm
but to sell; clothing is not made to protect,
but to sell; houses are built, not to shelter,
but to sell; and money is coined not to
represent values in exchange, but to sell.
To sell, to sell, to sell for gain I That is
the principle animating ali our social tran
sactions. Whereb' it comes about that
humanity serves the Social Organization,
not the social organization Humanity.
Whereby it likewise comès about that in
our best times, our highest ambition is to
do bad work and get it ieceived as good,
and our masters' highest ambition is to get
bad produets on the market at the price of
good oiies. Big and little, ali are seeking to
get something for nothing; and the real
purpose of producing at ali, which should
be to build up and preserve good bodies
and good brains by the use of good, honest
wholesome produets, is entìrely forgotten.
Whereby, also, it comes about that in our
evil times like now, we find purselves
helplessty staringat this great vague black
ghost, the Panie, not knowiug what to do
to help ourselves, 'thougli there is plenty in
the land', though the will to live is as
strong as ever,' and the brain is here, and
the muscle is here, and ali mauner of ma
terial is hére. w
They raised a cry that gold was not liere;
how and why it got away, those Who know
ali about it have taken good care to muddle
well. But supposing it had goue away : is
gold the thing any of us stand eminently in
need of ? Suppose that ali the gold ì in the
.world were transmuted into dust by some
philosopher's stone (its use as money has
transmuted flesh into dust often eneugh) ;
should we be reasouable creatures, theu, to
sit down and die in the midst of the wheat
and the corn ? Do we clothe ourselves,
warm ourselves, feed ourselves, with gold ?
Then why do we ali stop doing these things
because gold should have vanished ? How
much gold dany of you ever see auyway?
Most of you see it occasioually in the shape
of a fi ve dollar piece in your pay envelope,
which you are generally auxious to change
for paper so that you will not accidentaly
hand it out as a new cent. As gold you
have no earthly use for it, while as money
you prefer the paper which you proceed to
exchange for things you need bread,
butter, meat, potatoes, milk, cottoli, linen,
and wool. Why, then, is it not possible to
go 011 producing arid exchanging these
things, withoùt reference to what the
owners of gold are doing with their little
usable commodity ? WThy ? Because in your
sublime stupidity and belief in those who
rule and exploit you think wThat the gold
owners waut you to think; i. e., that you
cannot trade coats for sugars, nor rye for
shoes, unless yoiy are able to trade the
paper representative of the rye or the coats
for this starvation metal that you do not
want and cannot use; and because, in purs
uance of your delusion, you are willing to
uphold the great pyramid of gain which
has its base on you and its apex in J. P.
Morgan. For years you went on creating
values for your employers far in excess of
what you received; they pocketed the differ
ence. For the same years your employers
went on amassing these values, which they
must now tura over in great part to the
Napoleons of Fmance. who have seized the
opportune moment to squeeze them.
By the continuous opèration of the proc
ess of giving more than you get, it finally
arrives that the gatherers of gain have
gotten produets into their possession and
are not able to part with them, because the
giver of gain have nothing more to give.
Meanwhile the gain-gatherers' inaugurate a
fiercer looting of each other. The owners
of gold, the king commodity, proceed to
concentrate it in their own chosen places,
and the cry goes abroad that "the people
are hoardiug". The people", save the
money ! How much have you hoarded3'ou
who read this ? How many do you know
who have anything to board ? And for
those industrious and saving souls who may
have succeeded in ptitting away two or
three hundred dollars in the bank, in the
course of five years' work .(the withdrawal
of which by the "hoarders" is sometimes
said to have caused this panie), what will
have bicorne of their "hoards" at the end
of two or three months out of'work ?
One Lesi i e M. Shaw, former Secretary of
the Treasury, is reported as saving that
one of the poteut causes of the panie is,
that "the American people have been living
extravagantly, the prdetice being well
nigh uni versai." while at the conclusion of
the same speech he regrets that the people,.
having lost confidence, have withdrawu
their money and are selfishly hoardiug it.
O wondrous opèration! You spend your
money and you get a panie, or you put it
in your stockings and you get a panie! "Be
damned if you do, and be damned if yeti
don't".
You have been extravagant, you people
who live, a family of you, in three rooms
up the back stairs of a tuiement, for which
you pay $3-50 a week rent. You have
eaten too much and worn too many good
clothes have you ? The weeckly ex
pense.per individuai counts up to five or
six dollars. That is extravagant ! You
should learn to live 011 three dollars a week
and put the other two or three in the bank-,
so that the gentlemen of fìnance may have
wherewith to bùy more bonds after they
have creatèd a demand for them ! Or,
providentially, in emergeucy, to tban to
your boss to pay your wages with ! Until
it dawns 011 the latter that as you can
live 011 less, he may as well cut your wages
and put the money to is' own account;
wThereby we shall the sooner circle round
again to the condition where production
will stop because you have nothing left
wherewith to buy back your produets; and
the owners òf gold will once more proceed
to fleece the owners of other commodities,
because of the ruinous idea that there is a
special virtue in gold redemption. That
will be the result of economizing on food
and clothes, so far a"staving off panics is
concerned ; you may wonder somewhat
what sort of an effect it is going to have on
your bone and muscle, too. '
And now you are hoardiug ! Having
wasted your substance in riotous living,
you are putting it in your stockings besides
and that causes the panie. Because if you
don't furnish money to the banks, how
shall they do business ?
Verily, American people, you are very
wonderf ul beings ! You eat your cake and
you have ìt, too; and you haven't got it
because you have it. Thus Mr. Shaw and his
wisdom.
But you, poor people, you know it is ali
and infàmous lie. Facing the cruel winter,
weather, with heither hoard behind you nor
hope before you, and knowing well that so
far from having been extravagant you have
beenpitifullypenurious counting thenickels
and the dimes with hateful parsimony, you
know that whatever has the panic it: was not
your "extravagance" nor your hoard m$
You know that what you have been extrava
gant in as been the eyesight you bave wasted
in dimly lighted or glaringly lightedsttojis,
the muscle you have exhausted ira the loap,
overtinie stretehes, the blood trini has gone
impure, filled with the poisouoftEce factory
air. These you have wasted ruirioasly, but
nothing else. You have not "purclisistd city
property on the mortgage pian," nor McoaI
and iron mines," nor "timbered land"; jott
have not"purchastd high-grade stock smil
bonds with borrowed money," nor ' 'invested
in railway enterprises" ; your credit isii't
good for that. Such dealiiig are ali the
legitimate and inevitable working of the
present social organization, which you serve,
but which does not serve you ; which ìs
callous to your present misery, which will
permit you to die in the midst of the wealtli
you have helped to create.
Ali pauics are caused ultimately by this
system under which one man is forcecl to
work for another, and gives up the whole
of his product for a part : ,whenee it must
inevitably result that masses of wealth ac
cumulate in the hands of some. The longer
the process goes 011, the less the inASH will
have, and the more the accumulatore.
The specific period for precipitating a
panie is deliberately determiued, of malìce
aforethought, by those accumulators who
possess the privileged commodities, gold
and Silver, particularly gold. The privilege
which these commodities have is, that these
alone may be used, or represented, as money.
This privilege they obtain and raaintain
thróugh Government, which is the tool
whereby the superstitious belief of the people
in the necessity of gold and Silver asameans
to exchsnge other product in made to serve
interest of those who own gold and silver.
Whenever the great dedlers in money
perceive that the wheels of production are
beginning to clog (in this case the special
cause of the clogging was probably the colti
spring and the contiiiuaiice of high prices in
food stufs long after nature had made ansesias;
by bountiful crops) ; when they observe that
enforced stoppage of mills and factories
isimminent, they begin to lay their, plans
for "gathering in the sheaves". They cali
I in the gold, they hoard, they ruin banks,
business men, manufacturers, in order that
they may pick up values cheap, and mortgage
future production in the same old way by
getting their tool, the Government, to gp
in debt to them in the people s uarae, ancì
pay them interest out of the people 'spocketJ
Thus we, who were not alive in the time of
the civil war, were bound to a debt eie we
were bora, and have gone on paying for
dead men's quarrels year after year : and
so our unborn descendants are mortgpgecl
now to pay for our stupidities.
Mr. Cortelyou and Mr. Roosevelt bave
settled the difficulty -in the time-iionoreci
way, by putting us in debt ; and Mr. Mor
gan has released his gold till the nex time.
Men and women who work (when you
are allowed to) , whose purpose in life would
of preferencebe to make good, honest, txseful
produets, which shall go to build up life,
and in return for which you desire to
enjoy the like service of others, there nerer '
