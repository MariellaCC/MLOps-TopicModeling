The Truth About
THE
ITALIAN TURKISH WAR
It is only right and just that
the people Hhould know the
truth, yes, the whole truth,about
the war now in progress between
Italy and Turkey for supremacy
of the Tripoli territory. Unfort
unately many papers have
published garbled, unathentfc,
sensational stories, proclaiming
in large headlines, horrible sto
ries of unspeakable cruelty and
perfidy on the part of the Italian
army toward the non combatants
old men, women and helpless
children. Let us look to the
reason for these stories and
what, if any truth there is m
them.
Htorirs of Cruelty Denied.
It is noticeable that most of
these stories and reports, have
emanated not from the real seat
of the war, but rather from Con
stantinople and Malta,the center
of the Turk territory, and in ma
ny instances they have been
given to the press without even
an attempt to_ verify the truth of
them. W'e have reacf~abbut the"
Italian army violating flags of
truce, massacreing non comb
atants, failure to respect the
rules of civilized warfare, and
prostituting the high and holy
functions of the Red Cross.
It is worth while to remember
that Turkey is practically a
bankrupt nation; that her natio
nal credit is depleted, and that"
naturally, her creditors are
anxious to collect what is due
them. Her army has been equi
ppend and provisioned largely
by the same large money lending
interest to whom she is already
indebted in the hope that they
may save something out of the
wreck. This being a known fact,
may help to explain the reason
for such stories, for if by audi
report*, Italy is made out the
aggressor, and sentiment tnrned
against her, then the war may
end to the complete aatiafaction
of Turkey's creditors, the large
money lenders who care more
for the interest on their vast
loans than they do for the truth,
or the hue humanitarian princi
ples they claim Italy has violat
ed. However, if there is any
truth in these reports, Italy
should be called to account. Ik
Vlf renicnil>ered that she is a ~'Cf'
vili/s*d and christian power, a
party to almost every European
pact or treaty that recognises
the rules of civilized warfare
'and above all been a party to
the Hague Peace Conferences.
.This being true, then, if she viu
dates any of those rules 01
agreements there is ample rea*
on to believe that the other Eu
^rojsan nations actuated - by
humanitarian motive* would
demand that the war stop. It is
signifies: t that so far no great
power has intervened and raised
her voiee in protest, and also
that so far none of the pboto
praps alleged to have taken
s towing the existence of the
eimditioi's they describe havi
beiti published. Further, so fai
Turkey has made no appeal to
any of the power* for either In
terventlon or investigation. On
the other hand, Turkey's hands
cannot be said to be clean. How
recently has it been that Turkey
herself was before the bar of
public justice accused and con
victed of being responsible for
the unspeakable Armenian atro
cities. There was a case in which
unoffending clirisfain people, in
a time of peace, were slain by
the thousands, and plundered of
their possessions. The Turk was
well charactered by the great
Gladstone as "unspeakable", and
no other word so well describes
him. He is an alien with an alien
religion, a fanatic in advancing
its tenets, and believes that in
dying for it, he is taken straight
tq Mohamet's bosom. History
tells that it required alleliristain
Europe under the great Charle
magne to break the power ot
Mahomet ism at the battle of
Tours, otherwise Europe today
would be Turk and Mohametan
rather than Ayran and Christian
It has been said the Arab is a
non-combatant. Let us see. He is
tt" "bhrtHi oonsrn of the -Turk; has
the same religion and blood. He
joined the Italian army only to
betray it. It the war of the last
few weeks Italian dispacthes
from the front tell of dOl Italian
soldiers who were treacherously
shot in the back and killed by
the so called Arab allies. It is
true that these Arabs were
executed but not until they had
a fair and legal trial.
Hut they were executed by the
highest crime known to nations.
Treason. Treason to the power
to whom they had sworn allegi
ance, a crime recognized and pu
nished by all civilized nations.
Further, all christian agencies
are at work to render the war as
humanitarian as }>ossihle. The
Red Cross, that ministering
angel of the battle fiend is there,
and the Ited Cross knows no
friends or foe in warfare, it mi
nisters to both aliche, nurses the
sick and buries the dead, and if
such conditions exist as have
l>een portrayed, the Ited Cross,
being international, sulery
would know of it aud protest
agaist it who of the Ited Cross
has said a work to corroborate
the idle, yellow journal stories ?
Xot one.

tional integrity stand*. in the
light of hiMtory the lowc*t. We of
the United State* reeall _ how a
century ago it required the Ante
riran navy under Ilranbridge
and Decatur to atop their prac
tices of piracy and slave trading
and make them rcsjiect the lawn
of coniinerce and civilization,
and strange to nay it happen*
that the neat of that conflict
coincide* almost identically with
the present neat of war.
The Cauxe of thin War
The same duplicity of the Turk
shows itself in the story of the
origin of this war. They would
have you believe that it is simply
a case of the weak lighting for
life against the strong.
Nothing could 1m? further from
the truth. The fact is that the
Turk is unprogressive and has
(lone nothing to advance or deve
lop his country. Italy, on the
other hand, has developed the
Tripolitan territory and oj>ened
up its riches to the world. No
nation has the rigli to stop the
wheels of progress.The resources
of the hearth were given to
mankind for use. Italy was for
ced to her present position in or
der to protect her property and
the lives of her subjects, impelled
to the couflict for the same rens
on that the United States inter-'
vened in Cuba, and her present
action is sanctioned by the reco
gnized principles of internatio
nal law. Turkey in her centuries
of posession of Tripoli has never
showed strength enough to really
govern this country. Brigandage,
lawlessness and disorder have
thrived under her so called rule.
Is it not time that some nation
strong enough to establish order
and protect property and life,
should assert itself and do the
work the Turk has failed to do ?
Does not the experience of Kn
gladnnd in Kgypt justify such a
course?
I
The Turk has no excuse for
national existence, truly he is
"the sick man of Euro|iewho
haye lived this long only by the
sulference of others, and is it not
now time to let him die?
From the time he unfurled his j
banners over the minarets of
Constantinople in until the!
present day he has done nothing
to better the world, and his every
act has been one of cruelty, ra
l *" '
pine, and founticsm that in truth
inukes his name "l'ns|s?akttble".
Ix't the truth be known and
Italy judged fairly.
