THE CLAIMS OF ITALY
. by Dr. Leopold Vaccaro ===H
with preface by former Gov. Charles R. Miller of Delaware
Introduction
I The Hon. L. Heisler Ball, of Dela
| ware, has introduced a joint resolu
tion in the United States Senate de
claring that it is the sense of the
American Congress that justice should
, be done to Italy in the matter of
j Fiume because of her great assistance
j to the Allies.
I This resolution expresses what
! should be the sentiment of every fair
\ minded American.
! In the great conflict, although her
sacrifices were enormous, Italy did not
hesitate. Her devotion to the cause of
\ the Allies was unflinching.
Having been true to her pledges and
faithful in the discharge of her obli
j (rations, Italy is entitled to that which
she demands.
As the great issue before the Peace
Conference has not been justly or ac
curately presented to the American
public, those who will study the ad
mirable analysis of the Italian situa
tion, as presented by Dr. Leopold Vae
caro, will obtain a clear knowledge of
this important question.
The presentation submitted by Dr.
Vaccaro should be of material assist
ance to the members of Congress in
determining that which is a just and
equitable solutioii of the right of tht
Italian nation.

Italy's situation
So much has been written in thft
last few days about Italy's situation, j
| that it is difficult for people without j
j a thorough knowledge of the question
I to understand what the real situation
| is. Even among the conflicting pros
I and cons, very often confusion is arti
! ficially created in the matter in order
to spread an unjust and undeserved
prejudice against Italy.
For these reasons it is perhaps
worth while to epitomize the main
points of the whole question.
London secret treaty *
It is assumed that Italy cannot base
her claims on the London Treaty be
cause the secrecy of the treaty must
render it null and void.
But there is not yet an international
law against secret treaties; that law
is only President Wilson's words,
which do not constitute laws for the
universe. It could be noted that even
if this law existed, no law can ever
have a retroactive effect; and the
Treaty of London was signed more
than two years before the proclama
tion of this law by President Wilson.
It could be stated that the London
Treaty was not signed by America,
but only by the European nations
which, being then at war, were inter
ested in it, and therefore the Ameri
can President has no right to inter
fere with it, forcing the signatories
to make of it, in a German way, a
scrap of paper. It could be remem
bered that the Treaty was necessarily
secret, because it was impossible to
communicate to the world, and thus to
the enemy, the intentions of the Al
lies. It was also impossible to com
municate it to the Jugo-Slavs, be
cause they were fighting for the en
emy's cause; and the lands with which
the Treaty deals were then considered,
by all the Allies, to be Italian; and
Mr. Wilson was not there to pretend
that they were Jugoslav.
But there are still better reasons:
it is impossible to condemn a treaty
merely because it is secret. It is the
provisions of the treaty that must be
taken into consideration. If the pro
visions are moral and just, even the
adversaries of secret treaties must ac
cept it. And nothing in Italy's claims
is against the principles already ap
plied to England and France, and, it
is possible to say, to America itself.
And this is still stronger: In con
sequence of that treaty Italy entered
the war. She has done fully what the
Treaty asked from her, in blood,
money, and sacrifices. Is it possible
to conceive that the Treaty must have
had force regarding Italy's obliga
tions and can be nullified in that part
which conc«rns Italy's compensations?
The Adriatic Coast.
It is not necessary to affirm again
the Italianity of the Adriatic Coast;
those lands are Italian by ethnology,
"by geography, by tradition, by history,
by religion, by art, by literature, by
character. They would also be Italian
by ethnography, but for the violent
denationalization carried on by Aus
tria. In fact, those lands are more
Italian than Alsace-Lorraine is
French.
Nobody thinks of a plebiscite or
arbitration for Alsace-Lorraine, and
, the legitimate refusal of Italy to sub
mit her identical claims to a plebiscite
or an arbitration is represented as an
act of imperialism and oppression. If
no contrary plebiscite could take away
Alsace-Lorraine from France, so no
contrary plebiscite could take away
the Adriatic lands from Italy. In
■both cases the possible majority of
contrary votes could only be a conse-
J quence of violence, and violence is not
Right!
Arbitration is possible only when
right is doubtful; but when all the
rights are on one side and none on
the other, the latter has all to gain,
the former all to lose, from arbitra
tion. It is especially true in this case;
the arbitrar should have been Presi
dent Wilson, but everybody can see
how prejudiced he is against Italians,
only by looking at page 212-14 of his
History of the American People, Vol.
Fiume
Fiume is denied to Italy for two
main reasons:
1. Fiume is necessary to the peoples
of its hinterland as an outlet on the
Adriatic. It is very hard to under
stand why the peoples of the hinter
land, in order to use the seaport of
Fiume, must possess it. This is a new
and dangerous theory. Switzerland
has no outlet on the sea, and uses
freely the port of Genoa. Must Italy
yield Genoa-to Swit*erland? Trieste
can be a natural outlet for German
Austria in the Adriatic. Must Italy
give back Trieste to Austria? Why can
not the countries of Fiume's hinter
land use Fiume seaport, should it ba
assigned to Italy? Why must it go to
Jugo-Slavia, not being Jugo-Slav, and
not to Hungary, for instance, not be
ing Hungarian, but being necessary
for Hungary's outlet on the Adriatic?
In this argument it has been forgotten
that Fiume is Italian, and justice de
mands that it must not be given to
Jugo-Slavia or Hungary or anybody
else, but to Italy. Italy's democracy
and sentiment of freedom are the best
guarantees that Fiume will really and
freely be used by all nations concern
ed.
i And it is not true that without
Fiume the Jugo-Slavs have no outlet
on the Adriatic. This false statement
is apt to create a wrong impression of
the justice of Italy. Notwithstanding
the Itnlianity of the eastern coast of
the Adriatic, Italy has sacrificed a
great deal in order to give to Jugo
slavia what it really needs, and more.
Outside of Fiume, not less than fiv#
ports are left to Croatia south of that
port, from Bucari to Carlopago; and
if, as it now seems certain, Croatia will
be a part of Jugo-Slnvia, Jugo-Slavia
will have these five harbors in addi
tion to more than two-thirds of the
Dalmatian coast, with at least four
more ports. .
2. Fiume is not included in the Lon
don Treaty. That is true, but it is i
very difficult to see how this can be a
good reason for refusing Italian
Fiume to Italy. During the war every
body knew that among the aims of the
war was the restitution of Alsace-
Lorraine to France; nobody knew that
: France was going to pet the Saar Val
ley; and it is va»y hard to persuade
Italians that it is right to give by a
quite new agreement the German
Saar Valley to Fraifce, and that it is
not right to give by a quite new
agreement the Italian Fiume to Italy.
Moreover, if Italy did not ask for
i Fiume, it was Fiume which, even be-
I fore the arrival of the Italian troops,
decided to join Italy. What could
Italy do? Suppose America in this
case: what should America do ?
Simplv accept the plebiscite an'd de
fend her own city against any foreign
I interference.
It is also said that Italy cannot
ilaim what the London Treaty grants
lor and at the same time claim Fiume,
ivhich is not granted to her by that
Treaty. Anybody who looks serenely at
these things will be unable to discover
a contradiction in this. Independently
of the London Treaty, Italy asks
what is her own on the same basis
that France claims Alsace-Lorraine;
for Fiume the general, just claim ig
enforced by a spontaneous plebiscite.
Where is the contradiction?
The Islands and the Dalma
tian Coast.
Italy could claim, as hinted before,
almost the whole of the Adriatic east
ern coast, refusing to recognize it*
violent denationalization, but, showing
all possible moderation, has consented
to leave Jugo-Slavia more than two
thirds of the Dalmation coast. Bu
she is entitled to have all the island!
granted to her by the Treaty of Ixm
don, not only because they are inhab
ited by Italian population, but also be
cause they could be a good defense foi
her in case of war. In peace-timi
no danger to the Jugo-Rlavs can com<
from tjiese islands, but in war-tim(
they would be a great danger anc
menace for Italy, should they go t<
the Jugo-Slavs. And Italy has realiz
ed too much this menace from th«
Austrians in this war to consent the
same menace to survive in a possible
future war with the same people.
The Aegean Islands.
Not satisfied with trying to deny
Italy what is contemplated by the
Treaty of London, Mr. Wilson would
be delighted to deprive Italy of th«
Dodecaneso Islands, in the Aegean
archipelago, claimed by Greece. It
could be asked why Greece did not
claim those islands when they were
kept by Turks, and claims them now
that they have been for seven years un.
der the liberal regime of Italy. But
the important point is another one.
Those islands are mentioned in the
Treaty of London only in an incident
al way, because they were ceded by
Turkey to Italy, under certain condi
tions, by the Lausanne Treaty, Octo
ber, 1912. If Mr. Wilson is entitled to
revise the treaties existing before the
war in the name of nationalities, we
hope that he will not stop at 1912, but,
going back, we can hope that in ap
plying the-came principles, he is going
to ask England and France to give
hack to Italy at least Malta and Cor
sica!
Italy's Imperialism
Italy's imperialism is an old story.
In order to join the Allies and have
back her lands and her sons sufferings
under Austria, of which Jugo-Slavs
were a willing part, Italy refused
Trentino, Triest free-port, Savoy and
Nice, Corsica nnd Tunis, offered to
her by the Central Empires, without
any risk, with the only condition that
she remain neutral. A real empire,
one hundred times bigger than the lit
tle territory claimed by her as her own
on the eastern shore of the Adriatic,
which the Jugo-Slavs, beaten by Italy
in war, try, with the strange cpmplic-
I ity of Mr. Wilson, to steal from Italy
nt the peace table. It is very difficult
for the Italians to understand why
I England is not imperialistic in claim- j
: ing the German colonies and the sea ;
power, why France is not imperialis
tic in asking for Alsace-Lorraine, for
the Saar Valley and tlft left bank of
the Rhine, why Jugo-Slavia is not im
perialistic wishing not only Bosnia
and Herzegovina, not only Croatia and
; Montenegro, and it is doubtful if they :
| are anxious to join her, but to steal
also Italian lands and harbors, and
j why Italy alone is represented as im- I
j perialistic when she asks for the little
j that is her own by every possible rea
! son, notwithstanding the denationali
zation violently attempted by Austria
[ and her faithful servants,
j Of course, in the lands she claims
Italy will have some foreign people
| under her. This is a consequence of
' the natural infiltrations along the
boundary lines and, in this case, of the
artificial superposition of Slavs to the
Italians forced by Austria. But Mr. I
Orlando has clearly demonstrated that
no nation, under the contemplated ar
rangements, will have so little per !
cent, of foreign subjects as Italy, even
if she could have everything she is !
entitled to.
Austria's collapse.
A very strange theory is announced j
when Mr. Wilson states that Austria's !
complete collapse was not anticipated, j
j and the new state of things created \
j by that collapse is a good reason for j
the Allies to escape the obligations
contracted under the London Treaty. !
It is very easy to sec the absurdity of
this statement at first sight. Had
Italy scored half a victory, and left
! Austria crippled but living, she could j
| ask what the treaty promised her; I
having won a complete and decisive
victory, she must have less. In other
i words, Italy must be punished because :
her victory was too complete.
Mr. Wilson this, way is treating
I very badly, not only Italy, but Eng
! land and France. It seems that he |
wants to tell the world that England .
; and France are jealous of the great
victory of Italy, or that England and i
France were in bad faith when they
signed the Treaty, hoping that Italy
; was not able to win, in order that i
they could give her as little as pos
| sible of what they had promised.
But nobody can think that a treaty
signed by England and France could
be a "scrap of paper;" nobody asks;
J Wilson to join in the Treaty of Lon- |
! don; he can remain simply what he is: '
| quite a stranger to it.
j As a matter of fact, it is very diffi
j cult to see why Mr. Wilson must have
the final word in the settlement .of
things between Italy and Austria.
He has not signed the Treaty of Lon- ;
don; only one American regiment Mr. i
Wilson allowed to Italy in the last de
cisive drive, and that regiment had
not even a good chance to fight.
America has given to Italy quantities j
of material, and Italy is very grateful |
for it; but Italy has paid or must pay
| fully for it with great sacrifices, be
cause she has always paid more than
' the value of the American dollar, and
for a long time paid almost double its
value!
The fourteen points.
It is often assumed that some of j
Italy's claims can't be recognized, be- :
cause they are not in full accord with
I Mr. Wilson's fourteen points. It could j
easily be answered that these famous I
fourteen points are not an interna
tional treaty, and if there is a ten
dency to disavow the treaties, it is
hard to understand why the personal !
utterances of a single man must be
considered by all the world as a Sancta
i Sanctorum which nobody should at-
{ tempt to alter. But these famous
J fourteen points have been violated so
many times in order to serve the in
terests of America, of France, of Eng
land, that it is quite reasonable that
Italy should feel they could be violat
ed once more for the cause of justice
in her own interest. One of the most
important points of the fourteen deals
with the right of self-determination;
and any attempt at self-determination
; is excluded when any one among the
Allies but Italy wants a piece of terri
tory, and every self-determination is
refused when an Italian city like
| Fiume asks by a plebiscite, taken
| when Italy was not there, to join her
mother country, Italy.
More than that, Germany suiren
i dered under the express condition'
; that she had to be guaranteed by the
fourteen points, but Austria ciearly
refused to do so—she surrendered to
i Italy unconditionally. Now, this is
the strange and unjust situation. The
fourteen points were many times over
looked in favor of England and
France, notwithstanding the fact that
Germany surrendered only under the
acceptance of them; and they should
| be now applied against Italy in spite
i of the fact that they were excluded
from the conditions of Austria's sur-
| render!
The security of Italy and the
League of Nations.
Mr. Wilson affirms that the boun
daries he intends to assign to Italy
will be sufficient to protect Italy
against future aggressions. Nobody
knew of Mr. Wilson's competence in
military matters; but everybody
knows that not a single American
general has gone to Italy to study at
| first hand her difficult military prob
lem, nor a single American statesman,
not even the omnipotent Mr. House,
who has been so long in Europe, has
gone on the spot to study the national
and racial pioblem of the Adriatic.
General Diaz and Admiral Thaon di
Revel should have heen entitled a little
more than Mr. Wilson to say some
thing .about the military defense of
Italy. Has Foch had too much to say
about the French frontier of the
Rhine?
However, what is quite typical in all
this question is that Mr. Wilson af
firms that Italy will be quite safe be
cause of the League of Nations, and
therefore will not need any natural de
fense for her future security.
Let us be candid: The League of
Nations is a thing of which everybody
speaks with great respect, but in
which nobody believes; not England,
who asked for sea power and refused
to consent to the reduction of her fleet;
j nor France, who asked for at least the
neutralization of the left bank of the
Rhine, and now is asking for a mili
tary alliance with America and Eng
land; not even America, who wanted
to be safeguarded by the Monroe Doc
trine. and is thinking seriously of in
creasing her military strength on land
and on sea. It is hard to understand
why Italy alone should be obliged to
| believe in it and rely upon it! It is
■ quite natural that, independent of any
• other reasons, Italy should prefer to
; have the territory she thinks for her
security and to look at things from
I the identical point of view as France,
England and America; it is well to
' have laws, judges and policemen, but
j very much better to have our homes
closed; it is good to have a League of
Nations, but very much better to have
j the doors of our country closed 1
Are Jugo-slavs enemies?
! The whole of Mr. Wilson's state
ment is founded on a wrong belief,
He says that the Jugo-Slavs are not
enemies. But this judgment should
be left to Italy. They are not Ameri
can enemies now, because Mr. Wilson
recognized them two months ago, but
they have been and they are still
Italy's enemies, and the defense
against them interests Italy alone.
Some time ago Mr. Wilson was ask
ed by Premier Orlando to settle the
' Adriatic question, and he answered
j that he had not the time to study it.
J How it has been possible for him to
1 recognize the Jugo-Slavs, not knowing
the question, is a mystery that not
j even Mr. Wilson can solve. It is a
1 mystery of the same kind as this other
one: How was it possible for Mr. Wil-
I .son to publish so decisive a statement
over the most complicated question at
the peace table if he had not studied it
up to a few days before?
But Italy knows what ferocious
•enemies Croatians and Jugo-Slavs, the
most faithful servants of the Haps
burgs, have been to her; more ancient,
more continually ferocious, without
possible comparison, than the Ger
mans have been to France. And Mr.
Wilson, who is right in giving France
j every possible defense against Ger
many, dares to ask the Italians to
consider Jugo-Slavs and Croatians as
friends. Is Mr. Wilson willing to for
get the deplorable demonstrations of
:Jugo-Slav hate against the Italians
which were the immediate consequence
| of his hurried recognition of Jugo
slavia?
In order to put Italy in an unfavor
able light and Jugo-Slavia in a good
light, there is a tendency to confound
; Serbians with Croatians, and the
Jugo-Slavs are trying to represent the
arguments Italy brings against Jugo-
Slavs as directed toward Serbians.
This is a poor artifice. Italy knows
what Serbia has suffered, because
Italy herself has suffered as much.
But Italy does not intend to be the
victim of a trick.
Croatians and Jugo-Slavs fought to
the last against Italy and the Allies.
When Austria saw that the final blow
was coming, she turned everything
over to the Jugo-Slavs, trying in this
way to deceive Italy and the Allies.
Croatians and Jugo-Slavs, seeing that
the trick was unsuccessful, gave them
selves to Serbia, in order to be shield
ed by her and to share her merits and
camouflage their crimes. Of course
Serbia, notwithstanding the fact she
has got three or four times as much
territory as she had before the war,
taking with her the Jugo-Slavs, tries
to have through them more advan
tages if possible. But Serbians are
Serbians and still Allies. Italy has
for them the same feeling of friend
ship now as in 1916, when she saved
them. Jugo-Slavs and the Croatians
are Jugo-Slavs and Croations; that ia
to say, they are enemies, and if they
■ ucceed in deceiving Mr. Wilosn by
their trick, Italy cannot be deceived,
and knows very clearly that they have
been, still are and will be her enemies.
Of course, if Serbia is going to sup
port the Jugo-Slavs in their unjust
claims, Italy will be sorry, but she is
hound to defend her own lands and
sons, even against her.
Italy's and Japan's case.
Japan has been given control over
■10,000,000 Chinese by the Peace Con
ference. How can Mr. Wilson con
sistently refuse to Italy territories dis
; tinctly Italian?
Public opinion.
Notwithstanding the clash of opin
ions it is very easy to feel that the
majority of the American press
fully recognizes the justice of Italy's
claims; even those of the newspapers
I which are supporting the President
now feel that they are doing so for ab
solutely other reasons than the justice
of Italy's cause. Some are backing
the President only for the sake of
America's prestige; the President has
been obliged to yield to the strongest
nations, England and France, on al
most every point; in order not to come
back to America a defeated man he
must win somewhere. It is really a
misfortune for American generosity
and her sense of right that the Presi
dent has tried to find this somewhere
in Italy, the weakest of the big three
in Europe!
In England and in France the great
majority of the newspapers recognize
the just claims of Italy, and show
clearly that they can't understand how
it is possible that the same principles
should be applied to the Allies in so
different ways as to concede every
thing to the powerful and to deny the
rightful claims to the weaker. Worse
than that: that they should be applied
with the idea of favoring the enemy
and leave a faithful ally, who-has sac
rificed everything, fighting to the last,
side by side, with the nations she con
sidered the most loyal and righteous,
in the worst conditions of economy
and of safety. It is useless to say
that in Italy the population and the
press unanimously feel the wrong and
injustice of Mr. Wilson's statement.
But in France and in England some
of _ the extreme socialists have ac
claimed the President, approving un
reservedl" what he has done. No
wonder! But the wonder is that the
part of the American press which ap
proves, or pretends to approve, the
President, is quoting complacently the
approval of those socialists as very
important for the final issue of the
question. It seems impossible that
they are unable to see the approval of
that extreme party is the worst con
demnation for Mr. Wilson; they hope
to precipitate revolution as a conse
quence of the unrest created by him;
political unrest added to the economi
cal unrest consequent to the war. Did
Mr. Wilson go to Europe with the se
cret idea of starting revolution in the
Allied countries? Does he not know
that in this moment revolution means
Bolshevism? What would America do
if somebody should come to America
from Europe to start a revolution
herp?
But another thing should advise Mr.
Wilson that he is, in good faith, act
ing in the interest of the enemy: the
joy is in Germany and Austria by his
statement against Italy!
Italy's representatives.
Mr. Wilson has tried to convince the
world that Premier Orlando and Min
ister Sonnino represent only their own
opinion, and not the opinion of the
Italian population. Mr. Orlando has
clearly and serenely answered the of
fense to Italy's free and democratic
institutions. Every one who is ac
quainted with them knows also that
they are at least as liberal and demo
cratic as America's. But Mr. Wilson
didn't think, on the contrary, that
any doubt could arise as to whether
he voiced his own personal opinion or
the opinion of America when he
published his statement on the Adria
tic question. As a matter of fact, the
Senate has not had the least part in
that statement, and the American peo
ple, last November, clearly told Mr.
Wilson that they did not entirely share
his views. Italy feels that, and for
this reason, while unconditionally
supporting her leaders, she professes
clearly her long-time friendship for
America and her surprise for the un
just and unjustified personal act of
the President.
To Compel Italy to Yield.
- It is extraordinary how simply and
plainly some American newspapers ex
plained how easy it would nave been
to compel Italy to yield her claims.
Leave Italy alone in complete isola
tion, her supply of coal, raw material
and food cut off. Starve her! It is
strange that these newspapers do not
see the awful side of the thing. The
Allies would feed Germany and the
other enemies accused of so many
dreadful crimes; they would feed the
Bolsheviki in order to placate them;
and these newspapers are threatening
to starve and strangle Italy, to whom
the greatest part of the victory must
be credited, because Italy, having ful
filted her obligations, asks the Allies
to do their duty and to be loyal to
her. In very clear and proper terms
this cannot be called anything but
blackmailing. Is it possible that
America and the Allies are going to
dishonor themselves in order to back
Mr. Wilson's personal decisions?

Il Protagonista
Dopo aver apposta la propria
firma sul Trattato di pace impo
sto alla vinta Germania, il pre
sidente Wilson, il protagonista
dell'interminabile dramma di Pa
rigi, se ne torna in America, o
nusto di gloria che i posteri di
ranno se fu vera o usurpata, sod
disfatto dell'opera sua, poiché
crede di aver condotto a compi
mento una magnanima impresa
di pacificazione e di giustizia;
mentre tutto il mondo, non esclu
sa la maggior parte del popolo
americano, è precisamente con
vinto del contrario.
Wilson è in viaggio di ritorno;
anzi, quando questo scritto ve
drà la luce, il novello Giasone,
seco portando il conquistato vel
lo d'oro, avrà diggià gettato l'àn
cora sulle coste della sua patria.
Vi saranno qui liete accoglien
ze, feste trionfali, ricevimenti
magnifici, ma mancheravvi la
spontanea esplosione di entusia
smo di un popolo ed assisteremo
soltanto al disperato tentativo
del partito wilsoniano, di infon
dere un soffio di vita al rachitico
e ridicolo parto della Lega delle
Nazioni che l'illustre apostolo, in
cambio di presenti più preziosi e
più solidi, ha voluto regalare al
l'Europa mistificata.
Questo ritorno di Wilson dopo
il cerimoniale di Versailles, que
sti sforzi dei suoi seguaci, il cui
numero si va giornalmente as
sottigliando, da farlo apparire co
me trionfatore, ci fan ritenere
che egli voglia parodiare il trion
fo di Roosevelt, reduce molti an
ni or sono dall'aver visitato le
maggiori Corti d'Europa.
Ma quale differenza, quale a
bisso tra i due avvenimenti; lo
stesso abisso e la stessa differen
za che correva e tuttavia corre
tra la personalità mediocre che
non ha saputo elevarsi, malgrado
il momento storico favorevole,
perchè accecato da meschinissi
me passioni, ed il grande Statista
troppo immaturamente scompar
so.
Gli amministratori della cosa
non ingannano impunemente la
buona fede dei popoli; ma se pu
re sfuggono alle critiche dei con
temporanei, incappano fatalmen
te nel giudizio della storia, che è
freddo e sereno.
Tra due anni, anzi è da sperar
si molto tempo prima, Wilson
rientrerà nell'ombra, donde non
avrebbe mai dovuto venir fuori;
ma i veramente grandi rimango
no tali sempre e la loro fronte ap
pare circonfusa di gloria, anche
se sfiorata dal soffio della sven
tura.
Quando l'ltalia scese in campo,
per salvare dall'estrema rovina
quelle nazioni che oggi tentano
pugnalarla alla schiena ; fin dal
primo giorno il nostro Re corse
al fronte a dividere, col suo eser
cito, le ansie e le gioie, le speran
ze e le amarezze. E vi rimase per
quarantuno mesi, fino all'ultimo
istante e quando tornò alla capi
tale pareva invecchiato di venti
anni, ed immensamente dimagri
to, ma sulla fronte vasta e pen
sosa una nuova aureola brillava:
l'aureola della gloria.
Allora non era peranco inco
minciata la perfida opera della
stampa e della diplomazia alleata,
di svalutare l'importanza della
nostra vittoria, e tutto il mondo
salutò il nostro Monarca col ti
tolo di Vittorioso e l'impresa del
nostro esercito come la più mera
vigliosa della storia.
Il ritorno, dal fronte alla Reg
gia, di Vittorio Emanuele 111, fu
una marcia trionfale e nella capi
tale il Sindaco Colonna al popolo
delirante, diede la lieta novella:
Torna il Re e lo accompagna la
vittoria! ,

"Entered as sccond-ctass matter Aprii 19, 1918, at the post office at Philadelphia, Pa., under the Act of March 3, 1879".
Wilson toma anch'egli nella
sua patria ma non vi è accolto
con generale esultanza. Egli do
vrà lottare aspramente al Con
gresso per fare accettare il mo
struoso Trattato di Versailles;
ma l'esito gli appare tanto dub
bio, che si propone persino di fa
re anche un giro di propaganda
! attraverso le principali città del
l'Unione, per tentare di ridurre
gli oppositori colla forza dell'elo
quenza.
Nel Senato e nella Camera si
dovrà svolgere anche la mozione
{riguardante l'ltalia. Che cosa ri
solveranno in proposito i due ra
mi del Parlamento? La quistione
dell'Adriatico e segnatamente
quella di Fiume, sono state am
piamente discusse dalla più au
torevole stampa americana, fran
cese ed inglese, e recentemente
due opuscoli vennero spediti a
tutti i membri del Congresso e
della Camera Alta; uno redatto
per cura degli italiani di Filadel
fia, che riportava un articolo del
Prof. Herron, intimo di Wilson
e un'energica protesta dell'Histo
rical Society di New York City,
i argomenti formidabili a favore
del punto di vista italiano.
L'altro, riprodotto qui appres
so nel testo inglese, stampato per
cura del Dr. Leopoldo Vaccaro di
Wilmington, con prefazione del
l'ex Governatore del Delaware,
Charles R. Miller, venne, a suo
| tempo, integraljneiTte riportato
dai tre giornali locali: l'Evening
News, l'Evening Journal e l'Eve
ry Evening.
Vi sono inoltre le mozioni di
di diversi senatori, le quali tutte
indistintamente raccomandano
che, in vista dell'enorme contri
buto portato dall'ltalia alla guer
ra mondiale, le vengano assicu
rate le sue legittime aspirazioni.
Il materiale per la discussio
ne, come si vede, è abbondantis
simo e noi ci auguriamo che, nei
prossimi duelli oratori, i sofismi
di Wilson e del partito che lo ap
poggia non prevarranno.
Specie l'opuscolo del Dr. Vac
caio è una disamina acuta e mi
nutissima della quistione, che
jion lascia la più piccola lacuna.
Abbiamo voluto pubblicarlo in
inglese per due motivi soprattut-
I to ; prima perchè non perda nulla
della sua efficacia; secondaria
mente perchè quando Americani
(ignoranti e malintenzionati vor
ranno, in qualche maniera, me
nomare i sacri diritti della nostra
patria con il problema adria
tico, i nostri lettori potranno
metter loro sotto il gnigno una
; copia del nostro giornale.
Noi attendiamo il risultato con
calma e fiducia, ma se anche i
rappresentanti del popolo ameri
cano dovessero negarci quella
giustizia alla quale abbiamo di
ritto in virtù degli enormi sacri
fici sostenuti, sarà sempre il po
polo d'ltalia, se non oserà il Go
verno, a dire l'ultima parola.
LA LIBERA PAROLA.
