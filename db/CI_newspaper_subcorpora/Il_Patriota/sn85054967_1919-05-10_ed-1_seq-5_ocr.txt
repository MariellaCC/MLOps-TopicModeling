Salvation Army Commander, Dis
guised, Roamed Through Siums
to Study Intimate Problems of
East End Unfortunates.
Miss Evangeline Booth, daughter of
the late General William Booth,
founder of the Salvation Army, lias
given her life to the service of the
poor and the unfortunate. Few per
sons, if any, know she went about in
Evangeline Booth, Commander of the
Salvation Army in the United States.
the East End of London disguised in
rags that she might help the unfor
tunate. When her father stood erect
amid a storm of abuse and even physi
cal violence she stood beside him.
She knows how the poor suffer be
cause she has suffered with them. She
knows there still remains in the wreck
of a dissolute man a spark of man
hood that will kindle a redeeming
flame, because she has fanned many
flickering sparks until her patient has
regained his feet. She now heads the
Salvation Army in the United States
at the great moment of its career. The
old time slurs and doubts have been
banished. During the week of May
19-26 the Salvation Army will appeal
to the people of the United States for
thirteen million dollars to carry out
its after-the-war program. Contribute
to the Salvation Army Home Service
Fund Campaign. Remember, to the
Salvation Army "A Man May Be
Down, but He's Never Out."
Mental Move.
"What do they mean by saying,
•when the spirit moves?'" "It Implies
a mental process. With my wife, the
spirit moves every time she sees a new
house." —Louisville Courier-Journal.
To Avoid Counterfeiting.
In the production of their notes,
the Bank of England authorities'
chief aim is to issue a note which is
impossible for anybody to counter
feit. Toward this end, all the parts
of the note —the paper, the water
mark, the ink, the engraving, the
prinUng—are prepared and done in a
special, and, as far as possible, se
cret manner. At the mills where the
•paper is manufactured the most strin
gent precautions are taken to pre
vent any of the paper being stolen.
Of course, there have been many at
tempted robberies, but only once, in
the year 1562, were thieves success
ful in Attaining any of the paper.
Very shortly afterward forged notes
•were in circulation. The thieves didi
not enjoy the triumph long, for with
in a short time they were captured.
Being Neighborly.
After the workmen had cleared out
the landlord took especial pains to
ehow to each tenant the bill for doing
over his flat. The householders re- 1
garded that attention in different
lights according to the improvements
they had fought for and secured.
"Some looked frightened, thinking it
portended a rise in rent, some apolo-i
getic, some defiant. The third floor
right man was non-committal. Three
days later he called at the landlord's'
office and presented a slip of paper.
It was a bill for six shirts, summer
socks and ties, a straw hat, and a
blue serge suit. "What's that got to
do with me?" exclaimed the landlord.
"Oh, nothing," said the man airily.
"Just an interchange of courtesies.
Nothing like being neighborly, you,
know."
