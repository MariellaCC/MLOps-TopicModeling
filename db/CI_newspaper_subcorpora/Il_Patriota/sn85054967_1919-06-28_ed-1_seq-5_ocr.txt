THE OPTIMIST.
An optimist is a man who would
celebrate the anniversary of the day
©n which his leg was broken, l>ecause
the automobile didn't spoil his
elothee when it ran over him.
The optimist sees only the bright
side of things. Every dark cloud
to him has a silver lining and is per
j>etually inside out. There is no such
thing as misfortune to the optimist.
He has torn the misfortune page out
of his lexicon, and has used it for a
•cigar lighter. If he is poor, he is
Clad because he will enjoy so much
more being rich week after next.
If he is sick, it is a most auspicious
occasion because he is indoors with
liver complaint, instead of outdoors
catching pneumonia. If he has lost
his job, it will enable him to enjoy
a nice vacation. If he is starving,
itae remembers how uncomfortable fat
people are, and smiles. If the home
team is seven runs behind in the
eighth inning, does he leave the park
in disgust? No, indeed. Something
is bound to turn up in the ninth, so
"he bets another dollar and stays on.
In fact, betting, gold mining, and
stock selling would hardly be paying
games if it were not for the optimist.
He will bet on a three-legged horse,
because for all lie knows it may grow
another leg on the back stretch. He
will buy $l,OOO worth of stock in a
hole in the ground with traces of
ibrass filings in it and will pay as
sessments for forty years, greasing
-up his wheelbarrow every month in
order to be ready wliea the dividend

I Her Quiet Ways
By VICTOR REDCUFFE

(Copyright, 1818. by Western Ntwapaper Union.)
He never forgot the few lively, al
most riotous weeks that followed his
graduation. Leslie Warren had won
the best college prizes. His father
was more than ready to start him in
business in a good way. And there
was Norma Waldron!
Succeeding the period of vacation
and festivity awarded by his student
friends, there had come a week spent
at Hazelwood, the palatial country
borne of the Waldrons. About a se
lected dozen were invited. Norma and
her closest college girl friends were
the hostesses and from the start Leslie
had been attracted by Norma, and at
tihe finish it was pretty generally be
lieved that there would be a mutch.
Norma was a veritable madcap. It
never occurred to Leslie that his staid,
eminently, conservative parents would
never receive as prospective daughter
in-law a romp, a mere butterfly of
flashiness, folly and mischief. The
practical phase of marriage he had
never paused to consider. It was the

life is very beautiful to him, and he
is always happy. Once an optimist
was lynched for horse stealing out
west, and just before they kicked
the barrel out from under him, he
was asked if he had any last words.
Looking over towards the mountains
he murmured: "You couldn't have

"Norma," he said, "there is some
thing I must tell you before we part."
She slipped from his caress and
moved away with tantalizing swift
ness and grace.
"Don't spoil It all I" she responded.
"Walt till we meet again."
"But when?" he remonstrated.
"Very soon —I promise It. Then you
shall tell me all your troubles."
"Troubles! You mean the cause
of my alternate delirious hopes and
blackest despair!"
"Listen —they are coming. They
will be here in a few moments. Ruth
Glidden has invited me to spend a
week at Oakhurst. You know her
brother Percy well. I will so arrange
it that you, too, shall be there during
my stay. Is not that enough to sus
tain your hopes and banish your
despair, my loyal and trusted cheva
lier?"
And then she flitted away, a daz
zling sprite, and Leslie felt as though
the rarest gifts of the gods were his
of a verity. Oh! he was sure he had
found unending happiness and he
was still more certain of it when Per
cy Glidden met him one day and said
to him:
"This next week of yours belongs
to my sister Ruth and Norma Wal
dron. Of course we can count on you,"
and Leslie flushed slightly at the sure
intimation that his friend, was aynre
or" his a'ttacEment f<sr Norma. "You
* see, Norma is so used to excitement j
and variety and lots of company that j
it would be pretty dull for her down
at My sister is the dear
est, loveliest being in the world, but
her quiet ways are in very strong con
trast to the flashing, dashing methods
of our charming Norma."
The thought of meeting Norma and
of having her all to himself greatly
| relieved Leslie. During that interven
ing week, however, he had been a
good deal disturbed with rumors that
his capricious ladylove was acting
the flirt and coquette. There was a j
flashy stranger who was said to be
paying her unusual attention.
Leslie knew Percy Glidden well,
his sister Ruth only slightly. When
, he reached Oakhurst and was driven
along its quiet streets, it seemed good
to him to experience a certain restful
calm after the arduous social activity
that had become continuous and
wearisome. Somehow the old-fash
ioned home of the Gliddens presented
i a haven of restfulness. There was
a severe disappointment at the start,
however.
"Sorry, Leslie," Percy Glidden told
him, "but Norma is not coming until
1 next week —some important engage
ments is her plea. Do you think you
j can stand seven lonely days of our
dull routine?"
"Give me a hammock and a book
and I'll be the very peacefulest being
In the world, Percy," declared Leslie.

seemed as though a salutary spell was
cast over the volatile spirits of the
guest. He had always known that
Ituth, with her quiet ways, was a
strong contrast to Norma, but now,
as those quiet ways accorded with the
sweet, soothing peacefulness of her
environment, Leslie began to take an
interest In her that absorbed him.
Gracious, gentle, almost queenly in
her quiet, girlish dignity, when he was
not in her presence a strange new in
fluence seemed to have come Into his
existence.
What was It —new surroundings, the
fever of excitement subdued by calm
and wholesome environment, or was
It an uprising of genuine love quench
ing the fitful flash of fancy? Leslie
seemed to have entered upon a new
life. The house, its occupants, all na
ture appeared in harmony complete
with rational enjoyment, and Leslie
was sorry when that week neared its
end.
He was uneasy. He was almost
tempted to leave Oakhurst, not car
ing to again meet the old idol of his
dreams. Then, opening a newspaper
that had just come by mail, he read
an account of the elopement of Norma
Waldron with the man who had once
aroused his jealousy.
His spirits were rapt and joyous as
he realized the news, lie was free —

Astronomers aver that no one has

that it must be almost infinitely hotter

must amount to more than nine-tenths

outermost of the enveloping shell Is
about 5.000 miles thick, and is called
the "chromosphere."
