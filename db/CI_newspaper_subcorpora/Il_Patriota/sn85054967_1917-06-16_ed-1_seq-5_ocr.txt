A GENERAL SURVEY OF
IHE WAR
Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the
British forces in France, refuses to
accept Hindenburg's verdict that the
entente's spring drive is over and has
failed. As if in reply to the message
from the kaiser to the empress, the
British drove home a powerful punch
to the southwest of Lens, the big
French coal city.
"Good progress already has been
made on the front attack and a num
ber of prisoners have been captured,"
was all the official report said. The
past has taught the office to take
no chances in reporting "good prog
ress." Good news is, therefore, looked
for.
Unofficially it is figured that 713
airplanes were shot down on the west
em front in May, of which 442 were
German and 271 British and French.
British headquarters admitted t£e loss
of eighty-six machines, but as the
French do not announce any war
losses it is impossible to verify the
inference that they lost 186. The esti
mate of 271 is compiled from German
official reports. Total! air losses for
April were estimated at 709.
Arrangements have been completed
with the German government for the
withdrawal of all British war prison
ers from the firing line, according to
an official announcement. The pris
oners will be kept a minimum distance
of miles from the actual front,
both in the eastern and western zones
According to Rome reports Austrian
losses between May 14 and 29 are
estimated at 85,000 dead, wounded and
missing, including five generals and
forty high officers. One hundred can
non have been taken or destroyed.
The Giomale di Italia says that Em
peror Charles soon will proclaim
Trieste autonomous whereby it will
become a free city, like Hamburg and
Bremen. The announcement, the papei
says, will be accompanied by numer
ous amnesties.
Heavy gun firing reaching a stage of
great intensity in the region of the
dumes on the Belgian coast and in
the Ypres ben<f, particularly in the
Wytschaete sector, says the official
statement issued by the German army
headquarters staff.
Reports from both Berlin and Lon
don indicate the probability that an
important military movement by the
allies is under way on the Belgian
front —possibly an attempt in force to
hit the German flank on the coast a
crushing blow.
A pitch of notable intensity such a.*
usually precedes an attack has been
reached by the artillery fire near the
coast and to the south in the Ypres
district. The German war office an
nounces this extremely heavy bom
bardment.
Between April 15 and May 24
the number of German prisoners
falling into French hands reached a
total of 31,829, of whom 28,045 were
unwounded. This period covers three
phases of the general attack, now
temporarily abated, which the French
undoubtedly will continue when the
proper moment arrives.
Upon an almost forgotten theater of
war signs flared up of a new menace
to Austria-Hungary at a moment when
it needs all available man-power on
the Isonzo.
The Rome war office issued a brief
bulletin announcing the capture of
four villages in Albania, northwest of
the Adriatic seaport of Avlona. No
details were given, but the advance is
taken as the beginning of a new offen
sive against the dual monarchy whose
troops occuny roost of Albania. The
Italian forces there virtually form the
extreme left wing of General Sarrail's
Balkan army.
MORE TORNADO DEATHS
Fifty-two Persons Killed and More
Than 300 Injured In Missouri.
Reports from southeast Missouri
said fifty-two persons were killed and
more than 300 injured in the tornado
which swept about thirty towns in
that section Wednesday and Thurs
day. T
A report from Cape Girardeau said
seventeen persons were dead and fif
teen injured at Zalma.
A GENERAL SURVEY OF
THEWAR
British might asserted itself on a
gigantic scale and, after one of the
most tremendous blows which has yet
been launched against the German
hordes, the fruits of the great offen
sive have not been fully calculated,
so vast was the onslaught.
Today the town of Messines and a
score of other important points are
in British hands. The Germans made
prisoner already run into four figures,
with the totals increasing as further
reports are received.
More than 1,000,000 pounds of high
explosives was blown up under the
Teutons' forward positions —the most
gigantic mining operation in the his
tory of war —spreading panic among
the Raiser's troops.
The Germans were taken complete
ly by surprise, as proved by the fact
that the Twenty-third Bavarian regi
ment was being relieved at the mo
ment the attack opened.
The German forces holding Mes
sines ridge and the salient surround
ing it seemed to have been utterly
demoralized by the force of the Brit
ish attack. They attempted three
counter attacks, but there was no
power behind any of them. The heav
iest was absolutely broken up by the
British artillery barrage before reach
ing the infantry lines. The two other
counter attacks were attempted by
disorganized German infantry without
artillery preparation or any support
whatever. Very heavy losses were in
flicted on the Germans in conse
quence. Few who went into these at
tacks came out unscathed.
A British light cruiser and destroyer
flotilla sunk one German destroyer,
the S-20, and damaged another in an
engagement with six enemy destroy
ers at long range, the admiralty re
ported, in telling of a sea and air
raid on Ostend.
Ostend was bombarded with "good
results," the admiralty declared. Shore
batteries returned the British fire, but
there were no casualties on the Brit
ish ships and no damage doae to the
attacking vessels.
For the first time since the start of
the war France's official peace terms
have been made public. The cham
ber of deputies, by a vote of 453 to 55,
adopted a resolution setting forth the
republic's war aims, which are said
to represent those of the entente al
lies. These peace conditions include
liberation of all territories occupied
by Germany, the return of Alsace-
Lorraine to France and ,4ust repara
tion for damage done to invaded re
gions. The resolution, which was ac
cepted by the government, also favors
creation of a league of na.ions for
maintenance of peace.
LABOR WANTS FOOD LAW
"Drive on Congress" Planned to Avoid
Serious Unrest.
Following a conference with Her
bert C. Hoover, selected to head
the new food administration, an or
ganization was affected by represent
atives of the American Federation of
Labor, the four railroad brotherhoods,
the National Federation of Postal em
ployees and the "labor group',' in con
gress for a concerted drive upon con
gress to demand immediate adoption
of food legislation.
The labor representatives expressed
concern over the situation which
might face the country if prices kept
soaring and something was not done
to conserve this year's harvest, for
which it was understood representa
tives of the neutral countries were
bidding.
Reasants Urge Army to Action.
The congress of peasants in Petro
grad adopted a resolution calling upon
the army to submit itself to discipline
and defend revolutionary Russia. The
congress affirms the duty of those it
represents to defend the country
energetically and make every sacri
fice to sustain the fighting strength
of the army.

may even induce a soulful look to lin
ger in your eye—but—unless your
smile is really one of those magnetic
affairs in every day life,' you won't
succeed in cultivating it for the screen.
Screen smiles —the magnetic kind —
are born, not made.
How much more to be desired than
fine gold, then, is the inborn mag
netic arnile, and how fortunate the
possessor of one! Such a bit of prop
erty is the main asset of Franklyn
Farnum, the youngest brother of the
celebrated Farnum family, who has
become a screen favorite in the course
of a few short months. All the broth
ers have that indefinable quality which
we call "personality," for want of a
better name; but Franklyn has the
picture actor's most envied attribute
—the magnetic smile—as well. And
he has always had it. When he was
in the "legitimate," there was not a
more popular chap on the whole Amer
ican stage. Every stage-hand, call
boy, door-keeper on the entire route
over which he traveled, felt the better
for seeing him, and catching the re
flection of his winning smile. When
he was "in stock" in St. Louis, he
could attract a crowd by Just stand

latest picture is "The Clock" which

Funstsn's Nickname.
General Frederick Funaton was *
member of the Phi Delta Theta frater
nity at the University of Kasoas. The
general's fraternity brothers at Kanaas
knew him as "Timmy." This nickname
came about through the poor writing of
the fraternity member who sent in the
names of the pledges the year Funaton
became a Phi Delt The name was
printed "Timston" in the Phi Delta
Theta magazine, and in the form of
"Timmy" stuck to the stocky, cocky
collegian throughout his college career.

An Odd Court Incident.
Sensational incidents are not uncom
mon in the closing stages of famous
criminal triala One of the most re
markable occurred in Melbourne on the
last day of the trial of Ned Kelly,
known as the "ironclad bushranger of
Australia." A knife dropped from a
gallery overhead and fell at the feet of
the desperado in the dock. He had
every temptation to grasp it and put
an end to his existence, for there was
not the slightest chance of his escap
ing the gallows. But it was promptly
picked up by a bailiff, and its owner
was arrested and brought before the
Judge. He pleaded that the occurrence
was purely accidental, and the explana
tion was accepted by the court

sacrifices are all in vain.
New York '' Tribune''—Presi
dent Wilson is beginning to shift
the emphasis in explaining why
we are at war. There has been
too much transcendentalism in
previous explanations. Mr. Wilson
has insisted too exclusively on the
altruistic aspect of the war. In
the "Tribune's" opinion the fight
ing spirit of the country can be
more successfully aroused by an
insistence on the concrete griev
ances which we have against Ger
many than by treating the war as
a wholly unselfish enterprise, con
ducted with more or les abstract
aims. The war is now an Ameri
can war as much as it is a Euro
pean war. Americans should be
gin to think of it as such. German
arrogance strikes at us as well as
at France, Great Britain and Rus
suia. When we strike back we
are fighting for ourselves.
