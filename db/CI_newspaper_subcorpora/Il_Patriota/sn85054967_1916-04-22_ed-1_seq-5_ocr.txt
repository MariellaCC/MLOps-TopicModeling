Hard on the Proofreader.
Getting typographical errors out of
dictionaries is a task beside whicb
that little Augean stable affair of Her
cules was an aftemoon snap.
When the Oxford edition of the Bible
was published the proofs were read
and reread ten tjmes. Then a reward
of $250 was offered to any one who
should flnd a typographical blunder.
One was found in the first chapter of
Genesis. Dictionary proofreading is
even more difficult than Bible proof
reading.
i There is a tradition that a man who
read proofs of the Lord's Prayer for
that Oxford edition went insane out of
fear lest he made a blunder in it.—

Eastsr Sermon.
Love your enemies. Understand
them. See their burdens, their be
wilderment, their perplexities, their
obstacles and handicaps and thwart
ings. Let the Christ of you strike
with pity upon the locked gates of the
vaults of their ignorance, and cry
Lazarus, come forth! to the sleeping
- souls of them within. Let the Moses
g in you, the Pioneer, the Parer, the Ad
- venturer, the All-Believer, strike with
love upon the rock of their hardness
and asperity; let him will that living
water, kindness, shall gush forth, crys
talline, sparkling. And this day, so
shall it be. —Nautilus.

THE lìly is the Easter flower be
cause it is the glorious bloom
of Christ's country. It is abun
dant on the hills of Nazareth,
and in the later winter the regions
over which he walked glowed and
radiated with entrancing color, while
the air was fragrant with perfume.
The Hebrew word for the flower is
shushan, shoshan or shoshannah, and
though there is little doubt the word
denote 3 some plant of the lily species,
it is by no means certain what class
it speciaily designates. In the Holy
Land there are lilies that hold the
purpling blue of eastern skies; that
glow with the blood-red fire of the
desert's dusty sunset; that have the
pure white of spiritual appeal and the
grace in curve and line that touch
the senses like a strain of exquisite
music.
As we of the West know the lily,
the more cultivated species are the
wh:te or Madonna lily, the tiger or
tiger-spotted lily, and the golden lily.
A white lily in art and heraldry sym
bolizes purity, and in the pictures of
the Annunciation is often placed in
the hands of the Angel Gabriel. "Lilies
choir the golden way to Paradise,"
says a medieval writer; which, in the
values of the present, is given in the
appreciation of a Canadian woman on
first beholding the soul-stirring bloom
of a Bermuda field —"This is simply
heavenly!"
It is very probable that the term lily
as used in the Holy Land was generai,
not referring to any particular spe
cies, butto a large class of flowers
growing in Palestine, and resembling
the lily, as the tulip, iris, gladiolus
and the like. Thompson, for instance,
in his "Land of the Book," describes
a magnificent iris, which, he calls the
Hulch lìly, a view of which gives sa
lient point to the passage: "Solomon
in ali his glory was not arrayed like
one of these."
"This Huleh lily," says the writer,
"is very large, and three of the inner
petals meet above and form a gor
geous canopy such as art never ap
proached and the king never sat under
even in his utmost glory. When I met
this incomparable flower in ali ita
loveliness, among the oak woods
around the north base of Tabor and
on the hills of Nazareth where our
Lord spent his youth, I felt assured
that it was to this he referred."
That the lily must have been a con
spicuous plant along the shores of
the Lake of Gennesaret is indicated
in Matthew, 6:28: "consider the lilies
of the field, how they grow," and Luke
12:27, which bears the same admoni
tion. It fiourished in the broad, deep
valleys of Palestine. The Song of
Songs tells: "I am the rose of Sharon
and the lily of the valley," and also
among the thorny shrubs, for the
same book has it, "As the lily among
the thorns. so is mv love among tlie
daughters;" and among the pastures
of the desert, as is shown by this pas
sage from the inspiration of Solomon:
"My beloved is mine, and I am his;
he feedeth among the lilies." In many
other passages of the Bible the flower
is mentioned.
And that the lily must have been
remarkable for its rapid and luxuriaut
growth is evidenced in Hosea 14:5,
"I will be as the dew unto Israel; he
shall grow as the lily and cast forth
his roots as Lebanon." And that the
flower was briliiant in color is indi
cated in Matthew, where it has fa
miliar comparison with the gorgeous
robes of Solomon. And that the col
ors of the rovai investiture were pur
pie and scarlet is also implied in the
Songs of Songs.
There were many species of lila
ceous blossoms in Palestine, some ex
ceedingly gorgeous in color and some
exceèdingly fragrant. It is Dr. Isaac
Hall who noted the late winter carpet
ing of Christ's way by this widespread
color and entrancing fragraace.
"Most conspicuous. pernaps, are the
great red and blue flowers of the order
Rauunculaceae, where the anemone
and the ranunculus grow together."
says he. "They are not small things,
like our buttercups, but great wide
flowers of two inches or more in di
ameter, carpeting the ground with
patches as gorgeous as masses of our
briliiant verbenas. They grow every
where: and, like the other herbs, are
glorious one day and the next day
literally cast into the oven to bake
the peasant's bread."
SACRIFICE MUST
PRECEDE SOUL'S '
EASTER TRIUiPH
H. C. TOLLMAN, D. D., LL. D.
A DIVINE Fatner near to each
human soul, acting in arni
through the events of daily
iife, and a risen Christ reveal
lng God's nature to us through our
personal communion with him! This
ls the Easter triumph.
Modera Christian criticism may dis
cuss, as it is now doing, the historical
ind quasi-physiological problems as to
whether the risen Christ had a "ma
terial body spiritualized'' or a "spirit
ual body materialized," whether his
actual flesh and blood carne forth
Erom the grave, as the Gospel narra
tive most distinctly gives usto under
stand, or whether he bore that celes
tial and incorruptible body which St.
Paul declares is the body of the res
urrection. Yet we need have no fear
that the conclusion —if one be ever
reached in the future —will affect that
vital truth on which our Christian
faith has been grounded for nineteen
centuries.
The lesson of the Resurrection is
purely a personal and individuai one.
We do well to ask ourselves sobarly
and seriously what that lesson is.
Like ali divine truths, it is wondrous
ly simple, yet deeply significant and
full of transcendent responsibility. It
means nothing less than such life
union with Christ as to effect in us a
participation in his immortai and di
vine character —assuredly no easy
process, but the struggle and achieve
ment of a life in Constant touch and
fellowship with him.
The lesson of Easter plainly tells UB
that we must die to our selfish selves,
to our littleness, narrowness, pride
and hate, and rise to the eternai life
of service.
No Easter triumph can come to any
soul without first a Golgotha of indi
viduai sacrifice and self-renunciation.
Heaven is no flt place or condition for
a man who knows not what service ìs.
The risen Christ reveais the
tality of love realized in the soul of
man, a conception briefly summarized
by our Lord in the seeming paradox,
"He that saveth his life shall lose it,
and he that loseth his life, the same
shall save it."
The risen Christ reveais the immor
tality of truth. The self-opinionated
whose prejudices and preconceptions
shut out honest inquiry cannot com
mune with a God of truth. The rev
elation of Christ was the revelation of
truth, and Intellectual integrity is the
liberty of every son of God: "Ye
shall know the truth and the truth
shall make you free."
The risen Christ reveais the im
mortality of service. The divine ac
tivity is continually self-giving. God
ls forever showing the divineness of
service. This is the life of God and
It is a uniform, inflexible and eternai
law that we must enter into such a
life before we can approach the infi
nite ideal of humanity which reveais
God. The flowers and starry heavens
sing together because there is between
them the afflnity of showing God's
beauty. But between a selfish soul
and God there can be no communion.
The risen Christ reveais what was
centrai in the mind of God from eter
iity. This darling thought in divine
evolution was the perfect humanity
revealed in the Son of Man. We cali
Christ our Lord, our King, our Mas
ter and our God, and justly so, but the
dearest title to him and the one often
est upon his lips is that of the Son
of Man, because it shows what man
can be in him and through him. To
that humanity we link our hopes of
immortality, and we are confident they
will not disappoint us.
The lesson of Easter is simply this,
that we live the immortai life here,
the life of love, sacrifice, truth, beauty
and hope as revealed jn Christ; that
we enter into such individuai fellow
fbip with our Lord ss to enabje ns to
realize in him the life of God, for he
has said: "He that hath seen me
hath seen the Father"; that we ap
propriate his divine life expresscd in
the joy of self-denial, though it leads
usto Calvary.
