lì BIT OF GREEN 1
S: ■ ii
I By ELSIE COLBY.
(Cot'jight, 1918, Western Newapaper Uuioa.j
"Say, girls, I hear Rob Gordon Is
home, and they say he has enlisted and
texpects io be called away any time,"
said Betty.
Mrs. Dale, with he»- threr girls, Ann,
Betty and Kate, were seated et the
snpper table. Her husband died macy
years before, leaving a comfortable
farm, by which the Dales managed to
earn their living.
Robert Gordon, whose father owned
the next farm, half away, had
been a great chum with the girls In
their early school days, but when school
had ended he had gone West'to live
with an linde. It was rumored that a
lovers' quarrel hastened his departure.
"I should think he would have been
over to see us by thls time," remarked
llrs. Dale. "He always did enjoy
roaraing around our farm," with a
giunco at Ann.
"He'll be over, don't worry," Ann
said aloud, and to herself, "but 'lll
manuge not to be at home."
"Toh bet he will," declared Kate.
" 'Cause I'm going over to see him to
morr ow."
After the dlnner dishes were washed
and everything cleared away, the Dales
always setti ed down in their comforta
ble sitting room. The conversation
drifted to Robert Gordon and tovari
ons other topics of the day.
Finally Ann spoke up: "I'm going
blueberrying tomorrow morning. Any
body want to go with me?"
"I wish I could," answered Betty,
"but I've got some ironing to do."
"And I've gotto finish making that
blue dress of mine," answered Kate.
"Well, I guess you will have to go
alone, Ann," said Mrs. Dale. "You
know I never go."
The next morning Ann was up bright
and early, but not before her mother,
for Mrs. Dale was always up early.
With two good-sized palls Ann
started off.
"Look out for snakes," was her
mother's last warning.
It seemed to stay right in Ann's
mind, for she was always thinking
about them.
It began to get late. Ann was plck-
Ing a few berries to have the pails
brimful, when she spied something
moving. It was green.
"A snake !" screamed Ann. %
She turned and ran just as fast as
she could go, looking back every now
and then to see if the reptile was
pursuing her, when suddenly—bump!
What was that? Turning her head
Ann saw a fine-looking young man
looking down at her.
**Why—er—er, I beg your pardon,
Rob. , Er —I mean Mr. Gordon," she
panted.
"Oh, that's ali rigbt, Ann. Er—Miss
Dale. But why the sudden rush?
"Oh, I don't know; I'm so fright
ened ! I was picking blueberries back
there, when I saw a big green snake
coming right at me, and I —ran, that's
ali. Please don't cali me Miss Dale,
Rob. Ann, if you please. Oh. I was
so frightened !"
Ann swayed, but Rob caught her and
by fanning her with his hat he soon
brought her back to her senses again.
In her rush Ann had spilled most of
her berries nnd Rob helped her to fili
the pails again, and then accompanied
her home.
As he left her at the gate he whis
pered : "We're ali made up, aren't we,
Ann?"
"I 'spose so," laughed Ann, and she
tripped into the house.
"What makes you look so happy?"
questioned Betty as Ann entered.
"Oh, something," she answered.
"Well, keep it," Betty pouted. "Kate
went over to see Rob, but they said
he had gone blueberrying. You didn't
see him, did you?"
"Didn't I, though?" sang Ann as she
sallied into the next room.
A week later as Rob and Ann were
strolling along tlje country road, 'arm
in arm, and after the one word of ali
words, "yes," had been said, Rob ques
tioned Ann.
"Well, dear. what do you want for
your engagement gift?"
• "An eraerald ring," piped Ann.
"An emerald ! Don't you want a
diamond?"
"No, an emerald. You see, it was a
green snake."
"Oh !" laughed Rob. "So that's it?
Well, you shall have it."
"Well, you see, if it hadn't been for
that little green snake (Ann had fully
decided it was little) why our friend
ship would have been broken forever,
and now everything is mended. The
little green snake was responsible,
Rob."
Rob agreed, and true to his promise
One night some days later the Dale
family was again seated at the supper
table.
"What's that you've got on your
finger there?" asked Betty. At the
same time pointing to the ring on the
third finger of Ann's hand.
"Why, that's a ring," answered un
concerned Ann with a smile on her
face.
"Come, now, teli us ali about it,"
piped Kate.
Ann did. She told about the green
snake and ali. Mrs. Dale wasn't a
bit surprised, for she had been let into
the secret long ago.
r The girls laughed and Betty sang
out : "Oh, you little green snake !"
When Rob left to do his bit for Uncle
Sam, Ann sent him away with a smile
although it seemed as though her heart
would break. But perliaps she thought
of the little bit of green that sent her
the good luck to bave a soldier boy
to send away with a smile.
Eamed His Meal.
Governor Stephens was commenting
on the misuse of the uniform by per
eons who have no right to use it.
"They ought to be in jail," he de
dared, "but once in a while you can't
help but forgive the culprit. I have
in mind the case of a tramp in uniform
who asked a housewife for a meal.
" 'So you were in the battle of the
Marne?'
" Tes, ma'am,' replied the tramp.
" *What can you teli about that great
flght?'
"'Not a word, ma'am. I'm on my
honor not to reveal a thing I saw or
did. That's a very strict military
rule.* "
