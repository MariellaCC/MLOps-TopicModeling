the Lower House at Harrisburg.
As our readers are well aware,
Mr. North has, from a stand
point of ability and efficiency
made an excellent reputation
for himself at the State Capi
tal and he has for the present
session been entr.usted with
3ome of the most important
committee work of the House.
One of the important assign
ments which carne to Mr. North
svas the chairmanship of the
Appropriations Committee and
he has the distinction of being
bhe first country member to hold
that post. That Mr. North will
give a good account of himself
is evident from his past service
as a committee member. While
Taylor North is not making any
loud noise about the recognition
that has come to him through
faithful work in the Legislature,
it is nevertheless a fact that he
is recognized down at Harris
burg as being one of the most
influential members of the pres
ent session. Mr. North is not
only able, through good judg
ment and long experience, in the
legislative halls to serve his con
stituents well, but he is ever on
the alert to do things and do
them right for the best interests
of the wohle State, and Mr.
North s past and present attitude
has won for him the respect of
every officiai and every citizen
who appreciates loyal and untir
ing honest service. Taylor North
may feel justly proud of things
he has done at Harrisburg in
the interests of his constituents.
And the people back home ought
to appreciate in Mr. North the
best representative they could
hope to have.—Brockwayville
Republican, March 7, 1913.
Congressman North is a can
didate for re-nomination for a
second term and will appreciate
your support.

A Business Proposition
Politica should be a business
proposition. The voters should
look at politicai questions from
a business and economie stand
point. The people should look to
their own interests and not to
the interests of the candidate
or politicai leaders. The can
didate should not be owned by
any interests whatever. He
should not be a politician or a
demagogue. He should be a bus
iness man and should under
stand ali the business interests
of the district.
Then he should be qualified not
only to judge of what is for
the best interests in the protec
tion, development and building
up of the industries and inter
ests in the district, but also to
formulate laws for that purpose
and urge and secure their enact
ment. He should have a good
legai mind and a knowledge of
ìaw. He must be a man of force
and character. He must be a
man who will look more after
the interests of the district than
after his own advancement and
the vest pocket interests of poli
ticai leaders and their henchmen
He should be a man of the peo
ple and for the people.
This applies with special force
in the 27th Congressional Dis
trict in selecting a candidate
for Congress at the coming pri
maries. This district wants to
get upon the map and be admit
ted into the United Sates and
have the best interests of the
people urged with a vim .Of the
entire list of candidates none
possess and exemplify the above
qualifications as fully as does
Nathan L. Strong. He is thor
oughly acquainted with the in
dustries and interests of the dis
trict in a practical way. He will
not be owned or controlied by
any set of interests and no set
of politicians and their hench
men will run him. He is a man
of force and character. He is
an able lawyer and is qualified
in every respect.
The voters of this district can

Herbert G. Gates, one of our
locai young men and Sec'y and
Treasurer of the Armstrong
County Trust Co. bank, has
placed his name in our announce
ment column this week as a can
didate for Represeìitatdve to
the Republican National Conven

June. Mr. Gates will have a
strong following in Armstrong
County, where through his activ
ities as a Sabbath School worker
and his great interest in the
cause of temperance he has be
come well known as an upright
Christian gentleman. His
chances for success in the dis
trict are also considered by his
friends to be exceptionally
bright, and we should not be sur
prised that the honor will fall
to Mr. Gates to help nominate
the next President of the United
States, who will be a Republican.

Among the orders and vouihers for the salary of the County Commis
sioners, we found twenty-one orders and vouchers issued by the Board of
County Commissioners serving during the year 1915, for salary to said Com
missioners from June 11, 1915 to December 31, 1915, seven of said Orders
or vouchers having been issued to each of the three then acting Commis
sioners, the numibers thereof issued to the respective members of the
Board of County Commissioners being as follows:
To John Bennett, Orders Nos. 1110, 1175, 1271, 1403, 1555, 1653, and
1870.
To E. M. Ansley, Orders Nos. 1111, 1176, 1272, 1404, 1556, 1654, and
1871.
To J. M. Wakefield, Orders Nos. 1112, 1177, 1273, 1405, 1557, 1655
and 1872.
These orders or vouchers were receipted and the money drawn there
on by the respective persons in whose favor they were issued, and in this
manner the said John Bennett, E. M. Ansley and J. M. Wakefield were
each paid a salary at the rate of One Hundred Fifty Dollars per month
from June 11, 1915, to the end of their terms, being at the rate of
Fifty Dollars per month increase over the monthly salary of SIOO.OO paid
up to June 11, 1915; said seven couchers or orders issued to each of said
three Commissioners aggregating an increase of Three Hundred Thirty
Dollars is over and above the Salary of SIOO per month payable to said Com
missioners, the total number of said orders or vouchers, that is 21, issued to
the three persons making a total sum of Nine Hundred Ninety Dollars paid
to said three persons in excess of the fixed salary of One Hundred Dollars
per month from June 11, 1915, to the end of their terms.
The said John Bennett, E. M. Ansley and J. M. Wakefield were duly
summoned by papers served upon them by the sheriff of Indiana County
to appear before the Auditors of said County in reference to said above
mentioned vouchers on thel2th day of Aprii, 1916, at 10:00 A. M. at this
time none of said three parties summoned appeared in person, but John
Bennett and J. M. Wakefield were represented by W. C. Chapman, Esq.,
their Attorney, and Ernest Stewart, Esq., Attorney for E. M. Ansley, in
formed the Board of Auditors that it was not the desire of E. M. Ans
ley to appear at said hearing either in person or by counsel. At this
hearing no formai proceedings were had.
The Auditors of Indiana County therefore find that the said John Ben
nett, E. M. Ansley and J. M. Wakefield were overpaid in the way of sal
ary as County Commissioners, the sum of $330.00 each, aggregating a
total overpayment of $990.00. J. M. Wakefield having on the 18th of Aprii
1916, refunded and paid over to the Commissioners of Indiana County the
sum of $330.00, representing the amount received by him in excess to
his proper salary of SIOO.OO per month, is not hereby sur-charged; the
said John Bennett and E. M. Ansley, members of the duly elected and
acting Board of County Commissioners of Indiana County during the year
1915, are therefore hereby sur-charged with the amount of $660.00
We, the Auditors of Indiana County, having taken the oath of office,
January third, 1916, at once convened and organized, and after serving
due legai notice on the several officials proceeded to the performance of
