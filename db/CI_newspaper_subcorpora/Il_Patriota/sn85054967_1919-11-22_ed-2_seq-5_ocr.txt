Mendozn Is Old City.
Mendoza is the metropolis of west
ern Argentina. It is a city of some
size carefully planned and able to
stand comparison with any town in the
new world or the old one the point of
municipal beauty. It looks distinctly
new, but as a matter of fact it is one
of the oldest towns in the western hem
isphere. It was founded fifty years be
fore the well-known settlement of
Jamestown in Virginia, while the fa
thers and mothers of the Pilgrims were
still living peacefully in England.
Invisible Airplane Wings.
Wings of cellulose acetate, being
transparent, make an airplane Invisi
ble at the height of a few thousand
feet, also increasing the operator's
field of vision. Sheets one one-hun
dredth-incb thick are about as strong
as the ordinary wing cover, and the
weight of nine ounces to the square
yard is but slightly greater. The rap-
Id spread of a tear when started Is a
disadvantage that may be overcome
with a re-enforcing of loosely woven
silk.

Free Board.
A restaurant in Yuma. Ariz., dis
plays a sign that reads: "Free board
every day the sun doesn't shine." At
first sight the offer of free board every
day the sun doesn't shine might seem
a reckless one, but, as a matter of
fact, a day without sunshine in that
desert country is far rarer than black
berries in May. If it rains at all, it Is
only for "a very short time, leaving
most of the day for sunshine, so that
the sign would only catch a tender
foot.

Oidtime News Service.
In 1832 .Tames Watson Webb, of tin*
New York Courier and Enquirer, es
tablished an express-rider service be
tween New York and Washington
which gave his paper valuable pres
tige. Tn the following year the Jour
nal of Commerce started a rival serv
Ice, which enabled It to print Wash
ington news in New York within 48
hours of its occurrence. The most
notable express-mail service of all
was the "pony express," which carried
messages by relays of riders across
mofftitaHis and deserts and through
hostile Indian territory from St. Louis
to San Francisco, covering 1,9(10 miles
in 10 days.

POLITENESS.
Politeness is the lubricant which
enables people to crowd past each
other without friction. It was in
vented, when men were still savages,
to cut down the death rate. People
did not understand each other in
those days and used to bash in the
heads of strangers who jostled them,
In an endeavor to find out what
their intentions were. Later the
r.pology, the amende honorable, the
"After you, my dear sir," and many
other useful forms of politeness were
invented and warfare was cut dowa
75 per cent.
Politeness has now been developed
Into so fine an art that some people
can get along entirely on politeness
without the aid of any manners at
all. But politeness still remains the
language of strangers. The more in
timately we become acquainted with
a man the less polite we are to him.
When two men salute each other as
scoundrels and punch each other in
the neck with fond smiles they are
very close friends indeed and do not
r?ed to resort to politeness in their
dealings at any time.
When people belong to the same
family they understand each other
very well and can not only lay aside
all politeness but almost all consid
eration for each other. They may re
veal their true selves without any
patent leather conversation as dis
guise and can be as disagreeable as
they please, knowing that the fam
ily tie can stand the strain and that
there will probably be no murder in
consequence c Whenever we hear two
people talking to each other with
comprehensive rudeness and no dis
orderly results, we may be sure that
they are relatives and love each
other so dearly that politeness
-would be as out of place with them
as dress suits at breakfast.
Nations are ten times as polite as
individuals because they only have
one-tenth as much faith in each
other. No mere man could use the

kind words and gentle conversation
with which the powers of Europe
conducted the preliminaries of the
big massacre last summer. Because
of this fact we should not put too
much faith in politeness. It Is
pleasant to the ear, but a rough
tongued friend with a loving heart
is worth a thousand well-bred con
versationalists with beautiful man
nero and prospectuses for get-rich
quick companies in their pockets.
