ALL ITALY OBSERVED
OUR FOURTH OF JULY
Celebra ti OH was Nation-wide With Exercises in Ail Cìreat
Centers; Tliree Huu'tred Tliousand Romans
Gatliered to Honor United States
Washington, July -4 —Officiai ad
| vices to the State Department from
Rome show that the celebration of
America's Independence Day— the
Fourth of July —was almost as wide
spread in Italy as in the United
Statesi Special demonstrations were
held at Rome, Naples, Florence, Bo
logna, Turin, Genoa, Ancona, Paler
mo, Catania. Perugia, Padua, Aquila,
Milan, Rome and otlier cities.
Throughout these centers the or
ganization was officiai, but the re
sponse was popular to a signitìcant
degree. Approximately 300,000 en
thusiastic people joined in the cele
j bration at Rome and the spirit every
where was the sanie. As one Italian
put it: "Italy's heart spoke to
America."
President Wilson's name was on
everybody's tongue and almost uni
[ versally he was described as "The
I President of Hùmanity." He was
made an honorary citizen of both Ba
ri and Fiorente. Italy is* stili be
decked with American flags and
there seems to be a popular inclina
tion to prolong the lndependence
Day celebration. Both press and
people apparently grasp the idealism
which brought America into the war
I more truly than ever. Editorial
comment on the Italian demonstra
tions were most sympathetically cou
i pled with favorable references to the
Presidenti speech at Mount Vernon.
Our Còlors Flying
Rome on the Fourth was a mass of
red, white and blue. More than 50,-
000 small flags were distributed by
! boy scouts and even taxicabs and
trolley cars flew our national colors.
The locai celebration centered at the
Victor Emanuel nionument which
Romans cali ' The Aitar of the Coun
try." A huge parade ended there
' and the exercises were begun before
- a crowd estimated at more than a
£ quarter of a million people. One at
? tractive feature of the exercises was
> the release of several hundred car
s rier pigeons carrying "salutes to
c America."
>! The speakers included Mayor Co
j lcnna, Minister Bissolati, Senator
- Cotillo, Senator Ruffini, and Major
Byrne, of the American Red Cross.
Mayor Prince Colonna declared that
| "Italy honors in Rome the glorious
American Republic and the celebra
tion is worthy of this hour of vie
tory. The cause of Italy is the cause
of America, as it is the cause of ali
mankind and Roman civilization.
"1 speak in the name of the Italian
government," said Minister Bissola
ti. is for us more precious
than peace. We will go on fighting
l'or the right of peoples to govern
themselves and for the freedom of ali
small nations. We will sacrifice our
' lives, our fortunes and ali that we
possess to accomplish such a duty,
and we are proud that the day has at
last arrived when America can give
ber blood for those principles for
which she was born. At the moment
cf entering this terrible conflict and
throwing their lives into this most
terrilìc struggle the people of the
United States, through their Presi
dent, were moved by the same prin
ciples which brought this nation also
into life."
Mutilateli Heroes.
Here the Minister turned to a
group of Italian and American muti
lated heroes who were participants
in the celebration. "You wounded
and mutilated," he said, "wear the
uniform of the Army of the Stars and
Stripes. Many of you are of Italian
blood. You have come here to dem
onstrate your inextinguishable love
for the Mother, also mutilated like
you. You can hardly imagine the
strength which will issue from you
to our soldiers at the front. It is a
strength which cannot be measured
againat regiments and guns because
it is a soul energy much more to be
feared by the enemy than even ter
ritorial gains or the mass power of
regiments."
Senator Cotillo also referred to
the group of wounded, saying: "This
celebration has a direct relation to
the immortai ideal of liberty for
which America, Italy and the other
Allies are fighting and of which the

American mutilated here preseut are
such glorious representatives."
Senator Ruffini described the be
ginnings of America and the politicai
foundations on which the nation
rests and gave many evidences of the
tordial relations between ltaly and
the United States. Major Byrne de
clared that America was ready for V
:
any sacriflce necessary to achieve vie
tory and had placed her entire re
sources at the disposai of the Allies.
Greetings from the American army
were offered by an Italian-American
captain, who captured a German ma
chine gun single handed.
After the exercises at the Victor
Emanuel monument those who had
taken part paraded to the American
Embassy. There the Honorable Bar
zilai, meniber of the Chamber ot Dep
uties, presemed to Ani bassa do r Page
this resolution adopted by the peo
ple of Home: "From the Aitar of
the Fathetland the government and
the people on the anniversary of the
birth of America sends this express
sion of its adrairation and gratitude
to the generoua, American nation and
its leader detending the liberty of
| the world." Concluding bis address
Barsilai said, "Teli President Wil
son and ali the noble people who are
l united with him that the faith, the
sacrifice and the consecration of the
American nation constitutes the
greatest aid that could he given ua
on the rough road to victory."
Mr. l'age's Address.
Ambassador Page replied in part
as follows:
"During one hundred and forty
! two years this day has been dedicat
ed by Americana to the cult of liber
ly. At first it was dedicated only to
signiticance was extended and today
we celebrate here in ltaly upon the
aitar of Patria the liberty of ltaly
' and the liberty of the world. As the
representative of the President of »
the United States of America, who,
in the name of the democracy over
which he presides has raised his
voice for the liberty of mankind
throughout the world, 1 again declare
to you that our cause is eternai and
immortai like Rome, is victorioua
. like divine justice, and that ali the
resources of the United States in
men and wealth are dedicated to this
cause which cannot perish.
"American help cornes also to Ita
; ly. The starry banner is found to
day upon your hills. Although our
soldiers here are stili few our flag is
; the symbol of those hundred mil
lions of Americans in the United
! States whose national holiday we
celebrate. Throughout the United
| States there is no city, village or
| hamlet where ltaly is not beloved and
everywhere the people eherish heras
a guardian of Liberty."
War Movies Shown.
'I
At night there was a special pro
gram of American movies showing
our war activities before the Italian
| authorities and Ambassador Page.
D'Annunzio poem in honor of the oc
casion was ajso featured in the news
papers throughout ltaly.
I
In Florence also there was an im
, posing celebration somewhat after
the manner of a medieval pageant.
On the balcony of the historic Pa
lazzo Vecchio appeared Peter Jay,
[ Ambassador Page's special represen
tative, Congressman-Captain
Guardia ìnd the city's Mayor and Pre-
I fect. Minister of Food Control Cres
pi was announced by a flourish of
, trumpets from heralds attired in the
( quaint garb of the fifteenth century.
The Mayor handed the symbol
the city's citizenship for President
Wilson to Mr. Jay, who expressed the
gratitude of the President and the
1 American people for the high honor
1 and bore witness to America's sin
-1 cere friendship for ltaly. Enthusia&tic
' crowds from ali parts of Tuscany
' filled the great square.
An editorial in the Nuovo Giornale
of Florence ran as follows; "Flor-
enee has perhaps never assisted at a
} commemoration celebrated with so
much solemnity and unanimity by
the populace as that of yesterday.
The speech of the Honorable La
Guardia, deputy to the American
Congress, whose descent and name
■ are Italian, was one of the climaxes
of a memorable ceremony. The war
and President Wilson, of which *Mr.
La Guardia's discourse was an echo
and a trumpet toned impulse to en
thusiasm, has revealed a vigoroua
and generous America who fights for
; the supreme goal of our common
good."
