A mezzo dei giornali, che vedo
no la luce in New Haven e fuori
New Haven, noi pubtìcammo la
seguente nota:
"Durante il mese di Ottobre
ultimo, i 'Figli d 'Italia tennero
una Fiera alla Music Hall a van
taggio della Croce Rossa.
"In quell'occasione, si fece cat
tivo uso del nome 4ella iCroce Ros
sa. Infatti, alcune persone anela
rono in giro per sollecitare avvisi
che avrebbero dovuti essere pu
blicati nel Programma da distri

Coloro, che andavano in giro, "do
mandavano, pienamente autoriz
zati dal Comitato dei Figli d'Ita
lia, AVVISI IN NOME DELLA
CROCE ROSSA. Parecchi busi
nessmen Americani, i quali, per
ragione del loro commercio, ven
gono spesso a contatto con l'ele
mento italiano, e parecchi indivi
dui, i quali occupano publici uffi
ci, contribuirono generosamente.
Ma il Comitato dei Figli d'Italia
ricevette solamente 100 dollari dei
mille e forse più ricevuti nel no
me della Croce Rossa. La rima
nente somma, quindi, fu trattenu
ta da coloro che avevano solleci
tato gli avvisi, giusta accordi pre
si precedentemente con il Comita
to dei Figli d'Italia.
"Nel 26 Febbraio, avrà luogo,
in New Haven, la convenzione dei
Figli d'Italia. In quell'occasione,
sarà dato un Ballo ali 'Harmonie

buito un programma.
Alcuni italiani, pienamente
autorizzati dal Comitato dei Figli
d'Italia vanno in giro sollecitan
do contribuzioni, in New Haven e
fuori New Haven.
ISe coloro, che sollecitano avvi
si, si rivolgessero solamente ai
businessmen, noi non muoverem
mo alcuna obbiezione. Ma essi si
rivolgono anche ad individui che
occupano publici uffici. A detti
ufficiali, i sollecitatori deggiono
necessariamente domandare in u-
na maniera differente da quella
con la quale domandano ai busi
nessmen. Un publico ufficiale, il
quale occupa un dato ufficio per
volontà degli elettori, non ha cosa
farne di un avviso in qualsiasi
programma. Le loro contribuzioni
deggiono, adunque, IconsidjDrarsi
siccome "doni". E perchè essi do
nano? Donano appunto perchè
la contribuzione vien domandata
"in nome della massa italiana",
della quale fa parte il voto elet
torale italiano.
"A quegli ufficiali vien detto
che la "massa" è interessata nella
buona riuscita del trattenimento,
percui desidera che il programma
dia ottimo risultato finanziaria.
E quei signori danno per far pia
cere "alla massa degli elettori di
nazionalità italiana".

A Few Words to the "New
By the article published in cer
tain New Haven and out of town
papers, I said:
During the month of October
last, the Sons of Italy held a Fair
at Music Hall for the Italian Red
Cross.
On that occasion, the name of
Red Cross was improperly used.
Persons were sent around solicit
ing advertisements which were to
be inserted in the program that
would be distributed (during the
nights that the fair took place.
Those that were doing the solicit
ing, asked with full authorisation
of the committee of the Sons of
Italy, advertisements in name of
the Red (Cross. Many of the Am
erican business men fwho came in
contact with the Italians in "their
business dealings, and many in
dividuals holding public office,
contributed generously. But the
committee of the iSons of Italy
received only $100.00 of the
thousand dollars and over receiv
ed in the name of the Red Cross.
The remaining sum, therefore, was
held by those who solicited the lad
vertisements, by an accordance
made with the committee of the
Sons of Italy.

It is told, to these gentlemen, ; of advertisements, they had all the
that the "mass" is interested in right in the world to solicit as
the outcome of the entertainment many advertisements as possible,
and that the "mass" take great always in the name of the Sons of
interest in the profits accumulated
from the program. These gentle
men give to "please" the mass of
Italian nationality.
In this manner, the dignity of
the Italians, residing in this state, :
is debased, in that special way i
the dignity of the Italian voters
is debased.
We, that form part of the Ital
ian Colony in New Haven and
belong to the voting mass, strong

ings which greatly lower the It
alian name.
During the convention of the
Sons of Italy, at Hotel Taft, Mr.
Henry Giammarino, who was pres
ident of the committee of the Sons
of Italy, last October, held a Fair
for the benefit of the Red Cross,
complained in regard to what I
published, explaining that the
committee was composed of re
spectable persons and that not a
penny went astray.
He acknowledged it to be true
that the committee received only
$100.00 for the advertisements
published in the program given
out during the fair; he also ack
nowledged to be true that the sur
plus, minus the expenses for tne
printing of Ithe program, remained
in hand of those who solicited the
advertisements just as the agree
ment was previously made. He
added that the sum. which the
solicitors received, for Red TJross,
by those individuals who did not
want the benefit of an advertise
ment in the program, was turned
over to the committee of the Sons
of Italy by said'solicitors.
the members of said committee.
was to go to the Red Cross, many
Italy for the Red Cross.
The Weibel Brewing Co., The
Greist Mfg. Co., The Yale Brewing
Co., The Strouse, Adler Co., The
New Haven Clock Co., Sargent &
Co., The Whitney Blake Co., etc.,
etc., paid generously for the space
in the program. Why? Because
they were asked in the name of
the Red Cross.
Messers Gilson, (Lee, Babcock,
Tilson, Barnes, Pallman, who are
office holders, why did they pub-
lish their cuts in the program,
paying fcr the insertion? Be
cause the insertion of their cuts
was asked them in the name of the
Red Cross.
And the solicitors had also tak
en care to send, to the business
men, prior to their call, a letter in
which they asked, to said business
men, the advertisement for the
the benefit of the Red Cross. The
heading of the letter mentioned
that the Fair was for the benefit of
the Red Cross and was given by
the Order of Sons of Italy. It had
in a colum, the names of all the
members of the Executive Com
mittee and of the Patrons of the
Fair. Those two men, if they had
more time at their disposal and if
they had better fortune, could
have banked several hundreds of
dollars more than the amount col
lected, and the Red Cross would
have to stand the brunt...
Am I wrong in saying that, in
that occasion, the name of the Red
Cross was greatly, very greatly,
misused?
Do not the gentlem of the New
Haven Register think that the
chairman of the committee that
held festivities in honor of the
delegates here assembled for the
convention, deserves the censure
of the straight minded persons
for asking or rather allowing to
be asked, from the office holders,
an insertion in the program that
was distributed the night in
which at Harmonie hall, the
ball was held to honor the men
tioned delegates? Does it not
seem, to the gentlemen of The
New Haven Evening Register, that
the request of insertion from of
fice holders, which was done in
the name of the Italian mass, con
stitute, as I said, an indecent act,
because it lowred the prestige of
tjje Italian name?
Does not the gentlemen of The
New Haven Evening Register
think that he, who called me a
"trouble-maker", is an imbecil or
a malignant?
A ' ' trouble-maker' ' : the one
who, for the moral interest of
the mass, tries to have matters
proceed as they ought too, and
denounces, for the public opinion,
certain wrongs committed, in or
der to avoid, in the future, these
same authors to commit the same
wrongs. If they so define a
"trouble-maker" then I also call
myself a "trouble-maker".
But,- in my way of thinging and
according to all that are honest,
he, that acts in such a way, de
serves applause while his aggres
sors deserve the title of "fara
butti." Does it not seem, therefore, to
the gentlemen of The New Haven
Evening Register, that they gave
proof, at least, of little judgement
in heeding an imbecil or a malig
nant? The Italians of New Haveri
know with whom to deal. Certain
local men wanted to take advant
age of the Convention of the Sons
of Italy- by showing a political
power at the mass's expense. We
warned, through our paper, the
Italian Colony of New Haven. The
Italian mass understood the trick
and answered with dignity. How?
By not taking part in the manifest
ation.
How many and which were the
Italians of New Haven who at
tended the banquet? About one
dozen beside some members of the
committee.
Those, who were interested in
the outcome of the political show,
worked hard to have fa fetrong
representation of Italians at the
banquet;. they worked to have
certain persons, prominent in New
Haven for their financial, intel
ligence or commercial standing,
but failed in their attempts.
They invited the Presidents of
the different societies to be pres
ent at the "Vermouth of honor",
to which political personalities of
the city and state would have been
present.
The presidents did not respond
to their appeal. Why? The ans
weris plain.
It must be borne in mind that
the Italians of New Haven do not
care to hear from those who re
member the people only when
they must gain.
We have fought, are fighting
and will always fight to protect,
I in a reasonable way, the Italian
mass who earn their living by the
sweat of their brow. We are sat
isfied from the benevolence which,
on every occasion, was shown us
by our countrymen.
We, in our fight, have no object
to gain and therefore CHALLEN
GE OUR ADVERSARIES TO
PROVE OTHERWISE.
The gentlemen of The New Ha
ven .Evening Registtr did not
think it convenient to publish our
"protest" which we sent to them
last week.
Last Monday, instead, they
thought it opportunity to publish
an answer to our protest by Henry
Giammarino, introducing it by the
following note:
"An emphatic denial of the pub
lic charges made against the. Sons
of Italy relief fund committee by
P. Cobianchi, editor of the L'lndi
pendenterwas made by Dr. Henry
Giammarino and other prominent
Sons of Italy committeemen at the
big convention here this morning.
"In his letter, which The Reg
ister has had in its hands for a
week, but withheld from publish
ing because of the character of
the charges. Mr. Cobianchi char
ges the Sons of Italy relief com
mittee placed solicitors in charge
of the work of colecting contribu
tions to establish a fund for the
wives and children of local Ital
ians who were called to arms in
Italy during the past year and
that these jolicitors misused the
contributions and out of $1,000
collected by them turned out of
$100 to the fund.
Since Mr. Giammarino had said
things which are not exact and
since the gentlemen of New Haven
Evening Register have, by that
introducing note, affirmed things
which do not exist in our protest,
we thought had full right to ask
the above paper to publish our
note which was to clear matters.
We were answered in the follow
ing way:
"Mr Cobianchi,
Dear Sir: The Register pref
ers to keejp out of this matter, feel
ing that those chiefly concerned
might better settle things than
that thcRed Cross be draggedlh
to a newspaper discussion. It ap
preciate your courtesy in submit
ting it,
"Sincerely,
H. W. PHILL".
If the gentlemen of The Reg
ister prefered to keep out of the
matter and did not want to drag
the name of the Red Cross into
a newspaper discussion, ought to
have not published the note of Mr.
Giammarino because they did not
publish our protest.
If they had acted so, they would
have shown to interpret correctly
the just rules of juornalism.
But, having published the decla
ration of Giammarino prece ed ed
by their introductory note, in
which they brought forth things
Àgli onesti di New Haven
e fuori New Haven
Poche Parole al "New Haven Evening Register"
which we never dreamt of publish
ing, they ought to have published
our note. Their refusal gives us
a p erf et right to retain that their
note was not written in good faith,
but maliciously.
We would like to have the gen
tlemen of The N. H. Register ob
serve the to number of pages
of a newspaper, and its
frequent publications are not suf
ficient elements to give it the right
to consider itself to be "correct".
