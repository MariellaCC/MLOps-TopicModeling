Word.
Many Americans, including several of
Italian extraction, have asked us what at
titude the State authorities and our city
government will take in regard to the pro5
posed state-wide celebration, in New Ha
ven, of Italy's conquest of Ethiopia.
In other words, they want to know if the
above mentioned authorities will for the
sake of opportunism - that is for electoral
interests - resolve to render homage to a
treaty-breaker; to eulogize a man who has
subjugated a nation -- poorly armed, train
ed exclusively for hand to hand conflict and
desirous to live in peace - by machine
guns, tons of bombs thrown from airplanes
and especially by poison gas spread like
rain not only on the soldiers at the front
but also on defenseless open towns behind
the lines, killing or maiming, in this way,
defenseless women and children; to glorify
a man who has bombed neutral Red Cross
hospitals and murdered unselfish doctors
and nurses; a man who, in Ethiopia, is mas
sacring, by firing squad, hundreds and hun
dreds of natives, in groups of 40 and 50
men, in the unique objective of spreading
terror among that population.
WE ANSWER: - The people of Conn
ecticut will have the opportunity to know,
at the proper time, what they now want to
know.
On May 7, 1936, the New
Hayen Register published:
Between 10,000 and 20,000 Ital
ians will gather here during' the
first week in June for a gigantic
victory celebration, it was learned
today. Plans which have been under
way for the past three months took
form with the fall of Addis Ababa
and since the flight of Emperor
Haile Selassie, Italian Vice Consul
Pasquale DeCicco has. been flooded
with letters and telephone calls
from all over the state asking for
a huge demonstration.
"We are attempting to organize
a committee of Italian""leaders in
the various communities throug
out the state," Mr. DeCicco said
this morning. "It is hoped that the
Italian Consul General, Gaetano
Vecchiotti, in New; York will be
able to attend and we are endea
voring to get Ambassador Augusto"
Russo to come here from Washing
ton for the celebration."
New Haven was selected as the
site for the demonstration because
there are more Italians here than
in any other city in the state. Com
mittees are now being formed in
each town and - local delegations
wiUV shape theirplans according toj
the developments at the celebra
tion's headquaters here.
"We will probably name a com
mittee of 20 to take complete
charge of- arrangements," Mr.
DeCicco said. "Various, sub-committees
will be appointed in turn.
Afterwards, the Journal
Courier published, more or
less, the same news.
In the year 1932, in a local Review, Gov.
Cross, inspiring those principles upon
which the writers of the Declaration of In
dependence (Jefferson, Adams, Franklin,
Sherman and Livingston) affirmed the un
alienable rights with which the Creator has
endowed human beings, recognized that
the Fascist regime in Italy is in open con
tradiction to the sound principles of true
democracy.
Can now the Gov. Cross, as a good and
real American, associate himself to them
who plan to glorify, under WHATEVER
(GUISE, the criminal aggression and the
breaking of treaties consummated by the
Fascist regime? '
Sirs. Florence L. C. Kitch
elt, executive director, of the
League of . . Nations Assn.,
sent, on May 8, 1036, a letter
to Pasquale De. Cicco, acting
Italian Yice-Consul, in refer
ence ,to Jthe interview that
the N. H. Register had had
with him. That letter was
printed in the N. ,H. Register
and in the Journal-Courier,
and it is reported by us on
this page.

For American Policy
It is perfectly easy to understand
the devotion which American citi
zens feel for the lands of their
several .'extractions That Amer
icans of Italian . desdeint should
take pride in a military -exploit re
miniscent of the feats of ancient
Rome is natural. But' there are . re
sponsibilities of American : citizen
ship, as Well. In times as troublous
as these, they are not to be easily
overlooked. No one cani tell what
the future may "hold for, America
as for the rest of the civilized world
Of one thing we may be sure, how
ever: that unity and devotion may
be expected of every American
group. - .
Now it happena that Marshall
Badoglio has": subjugated a free
people with whom the United Stated
was on the best of terms. It hap
pens that the United--States -min-
j ister , was endangered in that sub
i Jugation. It happens that the people
' of the United States through their
- governmental i insttmnents have de
' creed neutrality j as their .official
attitude toward conflicts; and have
t not yet decided what attitude to
That Italian Celebration
To the Editor: .
. Sir : -4Can't' we do some
thing to persuade the Italian
American" leaders in New
Haven to drop their plan for
a state-wide, celebration of
Italy's conquest of Ethiopia,
announced in the papers to
day? I. wonder "''that they do
not see the delicacy of the
situation. Italy's invasion of
Ethiopia was in direct viol
ation of the Kellogg Pact
and was recognized as such
by our government. In view
of that fact alone, a- public
celebration of Italy's victory
would be in bad taste, to say
the least. Besides, there has
been a high degree of ten
sion between the Négro and
Italian groups, ; which would
be inevitably increased by a
public celebration of the sub
jugation of an African coun
try. . I feel very sure that a
parade in the nature . of a
triumphal procession would
have a very, bad effect .upon
the good feeling which we
are striving to create among
our national groups, locally.

THE ACTING VICE CONSUL PASQUALE DE CICCO IS A MTURMMD ATJERICABI OTI
!Zl.; .HE:RES!S)ES AT 244; YALE AVENUE, AND - IS i A VOTER OF HE TMTETH
In 1932, we said that the Hon. David E.
FitzGerald would have heen nominated
national ,committeeman from Connecticut
if he desired that post. In fact, the Old
Guard Ead a majority of more than 50
votes in the delegation "i that represented
this State to the Democratic National Con
vention in Chicago.
What happened at Chicago every demo
crat knows. And we don't want to be re
minded;of at- -
; During his six years as national commit
teeman from. Connecticut, Archibald Mc
Neil ignored the Italian-Americans of this
State.
He was not helpful to the democratic
party. He was never strong at the polls.
His only claim has.been his pre-nomination
efforts for Roosevelt in the year 1932.
The Hon. Thomas J. Spellacy - undisput
ed leader of Hartford County and one of
the strongest in the State "supported the
nomination of Paul Connery as national
commiteeman because he wanted to oust
Archibald McNeil. He gained his objec
tive. McNeil withdrew because he realiz
ed that he would have lost regardless of the
help he would have had from other leaders.
The nomination of the Hon. David E.
FitzGerald, veteran leader and one of the
ablest in Connecticùt, was a logical nomin
ation after the withdrawal of McNeil. The
Hon. FitzGerald deserves this position to
which he was entitled since 1932.
We are sure we interpret the thoughts
to many and many Italian-American demo
cratic voters iii saying that they, as we, are
satisfied that McNeil be out next jnonth
and the Hon.avid E. FitzGerald will re
place him; And then the New Guard will
be buried too. "
The Hon. David vE. FitzGerald and the
Hon. Thomas J. Spellacy have been politi
cal partners for a quarter of a òéntury. Mr.
Spellacy did show agam,' at the last Demo
cratic State Convention, that he controls a
very imponent number bf voters in this
State. It is imperative, therefore, that thè
Hon. FitzGerald and the Hon. Spellacy
work together as . before, shoulder-to-shòuldér.
The vital interest of thè Demo
cratic Party in Connecticut requires it.
